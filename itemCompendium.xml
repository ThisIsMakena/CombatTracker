		<value/>
		<weight>500</weight>
		<rarity>Legendary</rarity>
		<type>W</type>
		<text>This item first appears to be a Large sealed iron barrel weighing 500 pounds. The barrel has a hidden catch, which can be found with a successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check. Releasing the catch unlocks a hatch at one end of the barrel, allowing two Medium or smaller creatures to crawl inside. Ten levers are set in a row at the far end, each in a neutral position, able to move either up or down. When certain levers are used, the apparatus transforms to resemble a giant lobster. The apparatus of the Crab is a Large object with the following statistics:

&lt;b&gt;Armor Class:&lt;/b&gt; 20
&lt;b&gt;Hit Points:&lt;/b&gt; 200
&lt;b&gt;Speed:&lt;/b&gt; 30 ft., swim 30 ft. (or 0 ft. for both if the legs and tail aren't extended)
&lt;b&gt;Damage Immunities:&lt;/b&gt; poison, psychic

To be used as a vehicle, the apparatus requires one pilot. While the apparatus's hatch is closed, the compartment is airtight and watertight. The compartment holds enough air for 10 hours of breathing, divided by the number of breathing creatures inside.

The apparatus floats on water. It can also go underwater to a depth of 900 feet. Below that, the vehicle takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage per minute from pressure.

A creature in the compartment can use an action to move as many as two of the apparatus's levers up or down. After each use, a lever goes back to its neutral position. Each lever, from left to right, functions as shown in the Apparatus of the Crab Levers table.

		<text>An &lt;i&gt;arrow of slaying&lt;/i&gt; is a magic weapon meant to slay a particular kind of creature. Some are more focused than others; for example, there are both &lt;i&gt;arrows of dragon slaying&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;arrows of blue dragon slaying&lt;/i&gt;. If a creature belonging to the type, race, or group associated with an &lt;i&gt;arrow of slaying&lt;/i&gt; takes damage from the arrow, the creature must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking an extra 6d10 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much extra damage on a successful one.

Once an &lt;i&gt;arrow of slaying&lt;/i&gt; deals its extra damage to a creature, it becomes a nonmagical arrow.

Other types of magic ammunition of this kind exist, such as &lt;i&gt;bolts of slaying&lt;/i&gt; meant for a crossbow, though arrows are most common.

		<type>W</type>
		<text>Inside this heavy cloth bag are 3d4 dry beans. The bag weighs 1/2 pound plus 1/4 pound for each bean it contains.

If you dump the bag's contents out on the ground, they explode in a 10-foot radius, extending from the beans. Each creature in the area, including you, must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 5d4 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The fire ignites flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.

If you remove a bean from the bag, plant it in dirt or sand, and then water it, the bean produces an effect 1 minute later from the ground where it was planted. The GM can choose an effect from the following table, determine it randomly, or create an effect.

&lt;B&gt;D100&lt;/B&gt;   &lt;B&gt;EFFECT&lt;/B&gt;
01            5d4 toadstools
              sprout. If a
              creature eats a
              toadstool, roll any
              die. On an odd roll,
              the eater must
              succeed on a DC 15
              Constitution saving
              throw or take 5d6
              poison damage and
              become poisoned for
              1 hour. On an even
              roll, the eater
              gains 5d6 temporary
              hit points for 1
              hour.
02-10         A geyser erupts and
              spouts water, beer,
              berry juice, tea,
              vinegar, wine, or
              oil (GM's choice) 30
              feet into the air
              for 1d12 rounds.
11-20         A treant sprouts.
              There's a 50 percent
              chance that the
              treant is chaotic
              evil and attacks.
21-30         An animate, immobile
              stone statue in your
              likeness rises. It
              makes verbal threats
              against you. If you
              leave it and others
              come near, it
              describes you as the
              most heinous of
              villains and directs
              the newcomers to
              find and attack you.
              If you are on the
              same plane of
              existence as the
              statue, it knows
              where you are. The
              statue becomes
              inanimate after 24
              hours.
31-40         A campfire with blue
              flames springs forth
              and burns for 24
              hours (or until it
              is extinguished).
41-50         1d6 + 6 shriekers
              sprout
51-60         1d4 + 8 bright pink
              toads crawl forth.
              Whenever a toad is
              touched, it
              transforms into a
              Large or smaller
              monster of the GM's
              choice. The monster
              remains for 1
              minute, then
              disappears in a puff
              of bright pink
              smoke.
61-70         A hungry bulette
              burrows up and
              attacks.
71-80         A fruit tree grows.
              It has 1d10 + 20
              fruit, 1d8 of which
              act as randomly
              determined magic
              potions, while one
              acts as an ingested
              poison of the GM's
              choice. The tree
              vanishes after 1
              hour. Picked fruit
              remains, retaining
              any magic for 30
              days.
81-90         A nest of 1d4 + 3
              eggs springs up. Any
              creature that eats
              an egg must make a
              DC 20 Constitution
              saving throw. On a
              successful save, a
              creature permanently
              increases its lowest
              ability score by 1,
              randomly choosing
              among equally low
              scores. On a failed
              save, the creature
              takes 10d6 force
              damage from an
              internal magical
              explosion.
91-99         A pyramid with a
              60-foot-square base
              bursts upward.
              Inside is a
              sarcophagus
              containing a mummy
              lord. The pyramid is
              treated as the mummy
              lord's lair, and its
              sarcophagus contains
              treasure of the GM's
              choice.
00            A giant beanstalk
              sprouts, growing to
              a height of the GM's
              choice. The top
              leads where the GM
              chooses, such as to
              a great view, a
              cloud giant's
              castle, or a
              different plane of
              existence.

		<text>This bag superficially resembles a bag of holding but is a feeding orifice for a gigantic extradimensional creature. Turning the bag inside out closes the orifice.

The extradimensional creature attached to the bag can sense whatever is placed inside the bag. Animal or vegetable matter placed wholly in the bag is devoured and lost forever. When part of a living creature is placed in the bag, as happens when someone reaches inside it, there is a 50 percent chance that the creature is pulled inside the bag. A creature inside the bag can use its action to try to escape with a successful DC 15 Strength check. Another creature can use its action to reach into the bag to pull a creature out, doing so with a successful DC 20 Strength check (provided it isn't pulled inside the bag first). Any creature that starts its turn inside the bag is devoured, its body destroyed.

Inanimate objects can be stored in the bag, which can hold a cubic foot of such material. However, once each day, the bag swallows any objects inside it and spits them out into another plane of existence. The GM determines the time and plane.

If the bag is pierced or torn, it is destroyed, and anything contained within it is transported to a random location on the Astral Plane.

		<text>This bag has an interior space considerably larger than its outside dimensions, roughly 2 feet in diameter at the mouth and 4 feet deep. The bag can hold up to 500 pounds, not exceeding a volume of 64 cubic feet. The bag weighs 15 pounds, regardless of its contents. Retrieving an item from the bag requires an action.

If the bag is overloaded, pierced, or torn, it ruptures and is destroyed, and its contents are scattered in the Astral Plane. If the bag is turned inside out, its contents spill forth, unharmed, but the bag must be put right before it can be used again. Breathing creatures inside the bag can survive up to a number of minutes equal to 10 divided by the number of creatures (minimum 1 minute), after which time they begin to suffocate.

Placing a &lt;i&gt;bag of holding&lt;/i&gt; inside an extradimensional space created by a handy haversack, portable hole, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it to a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can’t be reopened.

You can use an action to pull the fuzzy object from the bag and throw it up to 20 feet. When the object lands, it transforms into a creature you determine by rolling a d8 and consulting the table that corresponds to the bag's color. See the &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters"&gt;Monsters Listing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; for the creature's statistics. The creature vanishes at the next dawn or when it is reduced to 0 hit points.

The creature is friendly to you and your companions, and it acts on your turn. You can use a bonus action to command how the creature moves and what action it takes on its next turn, or to give it general orders, such as to attack your enemies. In the absence of such orders, the creature acts in a fashion appropriate to its nature.

Once three fuzzy objects have been pulled from the bag, the bag can't be used again until the next dawn.

		<text>This small black sphere measures 3/4 of an inch in diameter and weighs an ounce. Typically, 1d4 + 4 &lt;i&gt;beads of force&lt;/i&gt; are found together.

You can use an action to throw the bead up to 60 feet. The bead explodes on impact and is destroyed. Each creature within a 10-foot radius of where the bead landed must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 5d4 force damage. A sphere of transparent force then encloses the area for 1 minute. Any creature that failed the save and is completely within the area is trapped inside this sphere. Creatures that succeeded on the save, or are partially within the area, are pushed away from the center of the sphere until they are no longer inside it. Only breathable air can pass through the sphere's wall. No attack or other effect can.

An enclosed creature can use its action to push against the sphere's wall, moving the sphere up to half the creature's walking speed. The sphere can be picked up, and its magic causes it to weigh only 1 pound, regardless of the weight of creatures inside.

14-15        Lawful evil
16-17        Lawful neutral
18-20        Lawful good

 

The candle's magic is activated when the candle is lit, which requires an action. After burning for 4 hours, the candle is destroyed. You can snuff it out early for use at a later time. Deduct the time it burned in increments of 1 minute from the candle's total burn time.

While lit, the candle sheds dim light in a 30-foot radius. Any creature within that light whose alignment matches that of the candle makes attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks with advantage. In addition, a cleric or druid in the light whose alignment matches the candle's can cast 1st- level spells he or she has prepared without expending spell slots, though the spell's effect is as if cast with a 1st-level slot.

Alternatively, when you light the candle for the first time, you can cast the &lt;b&gt;gate&lt;/b&gt; spell with it. Doing so destroys the candle.

		<text>While wearing this cloak, you have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks. In an area of dim light or darkness, you can grip the edges of the cloak with both hands and use it to fly at a speed of 40 feet. If you ever fail to grip the cloak's edges while flying in this way, or if you are no longer in dim light or darkness, you lose this flying speed.

While wearing the cloak in an area of dim light or darkness, you can use your action to cast polymorph on yourself, transforming into a bat. While you are in the form of the bat, you retain your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. The cloak can't be used this way again until the next dawn.

		<text>The typical &lt;i&gt;crystal ball&lt;/i&gt;, a very rare item, is about 6 inches in diameter. While touching it, you can cast the scrying spell (save DC 17) with it.

The following &lt;i&gt;crystal ball&lt;/i&gt; variants are legendary items and have additional properties.

&lt;b&gt;Crystal Ball of Mind Reading.&lt;/b&gt; You can use an action to cast the detect thoughts spell (save DC 17) while you are scrying with the &lt;i&gt;crystal ball&lt;/i&gt;, targeting creatures you can see within 30 feet of the spell’s sensor. You don’t need to concentrate on this &lt;i&gt;detect thoughts&lt;/i&gt; to maintain it during its duration, but it ends if scrying ends.

&lt;b&gt;Crystal Ball of Telepathy.&lt;/b&gt; While scrying with the crystal ball, you can communicate telepathically with creatures you can see within 30 feet of the spell’s sensor. You can also use an action to cast the suggestion spell (save DC 17) through the sensor on one of those creatures. You don’t need to concentrate on this &lt;i&gt;suggestion&lt;/i&gt; to maintain it during its duration, but it ends if scrying ends. Once used, the &lt;i&gt;suggestion&lt;/i&gt; power of the &lt;i&gt;crystal ball&lt;/i&gt; can’t be used again until the next dawn.

&lt;b&gt;Crystal Ball of True Seeing.&lt;/b&gt; While scrying with the crystal ball, you have truesight with a radius of 120 feet centered on the spell’s sensor.

		<type>W</type>
		<text>This cube is about an inch across. Each face has a distinct marking on it that can be pressed. The cube starts with 36 charges, and it regains 1d20 expended charges daily at dawn.

You can use an action to press one of the cube's faces, expending a number of charges based on the chosen face, as shown in the Cube of Force Faces table. Each face has a different effect. If the cube has insufficient charges remaining, nothing happens. Otherwise, a barrier of invisible force springs into existence, forming a cube 15 feet on a side. The barrier is centered on you, moves with you, and lasts for 1 minute, until you use an action to press the cube's sixth face, or the cube runs out of charges. You can change the barrier's effect by pressing a different face of the cube and expending the requisite number of charges, resetting the duration.

If your movement causes the barrier to come into contact with a solid object that can't pass through the cube, you can't move any closer to that object as long as the barrier remains.

The cube loses charges when the barrier is targeted by certain spells or comes into contact with certain spell or magic item effects, as shown in the table below.

		<text>This cube is 3 inches across and radiates palpable magical energy. The six sides of the cube are each keyed to a different plane of existence, one of which is the Material Plane. The other sides are linked to planes determined by the GM.

You can use an action to press one side of the cube to cast the &lt;b&gt;gate&lt;/b&gt; spell with it, opening a portal to the plane keyed to that side. Alternatively, if you use an action to press one side twice, you can cast the &lt;b&gt;plane shift&lt;/b&gt; spell (save DC 17) with the cube and transport the targets to the plane keyed to that side.

The cube has 3 charges. Each use of the cube expends 1 charge. The cube regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.

 * "Stream" produces 1 gallon of water.
 * "Fountain" produces 5 gallons of water.
 * "Geyser" produces 30 gallons of water that gushes forth in a geyser 30 feet long and 1 foot wide. As a bonus action while holding the decanter, you can aim the geyser at a creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or take 1d4 bludgeoning damage and fall prone. Instead of a creature, you can target an object that isn't being worn or carried and that weighs no more than 200 pounds. The object is either knocked over or pushed up to 15 feet away from you.

		<value/>
		<weight/>
		<rarity>Uncommon</rarity>
		<type>W</type>
		<text>This box contains a set of parchment cards. A full deck has 34 cards. A deck found as treasure is usually missing 1d20 - 1 cards.

The magic of the deck functions only if cards are drawn at random (you can use an altered deck of playing cards to simulate the deck). You can use an action to draw a card at random from the deck and throw it to the ground at a point within 30 feet of you.

An illusion of one or more creatures forms over the thrown card and remains until dispelled. An illusory creature appears real, of the appropriate size, and behaves as if it were a real creature except that it can do no harm. While you are within 120 feet of the illusory creature and can see it, you can use an action to move it magically anywhere within 30 feet of its card. Any physical interaction with the illusory creature reveals it to be an illusion, because objects pass through it. Someone who uses an action to visually inspect the creature identifies it as illusory with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check. The creature then appears translucent.

The illusion lasts until its card is moved or the illusion is dispelled. When the illusion ends, the image on its card disappears, and that card can't be used again.

		<text>Usually found in a box or pouch, this deck contains a number of cards made of ivory or vellum. Most (75 percent) of these decks have only thirteen cards, but the rest have twenty-two.

Before you draw a card, you must declare how many cards you intend to draw and then draw them randomly (you can use an altered deck of playing cards to simulate the deck). Any cards drawn in excess of this number have no effect. Otherwise, as soon as you draw a card from the deck, its magic takes effect. You must draw each card no more than 1 hour after the previous draw. If you fail to draw the chosen number, the remaining number of cards fly from the deck on their own and take effect all at once.

Once a card is drawn, it fades from existence. Unless the card is the Fool or the Jester, the card reappears in the deck, making it possible to draw the same card twice.

&lt;i&gt;
* Found only in a deck with twenty-two cards&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Balance.&lt;/b&gt; Your mind suffers a wrenching alteration, causing your alignment to change. Lawful becomes chaotic, good becomes evil, and vice versa. If you are true neutral or unaligned, this card has no effect on you.

&lt;b&gt;Comet.&lt;/b&gt; If you single-handedly defeat the next hostile monster or group of monsters you encounter, you gain experience points enough to gain one level. Otherwise, this card has no effect.

&lt;b&gt;Donjon.&lt;/b&gt; You disappear and become entombed in a state of suspended animation in an extradimensional sphere. Everything you were wearing and carrying stays behind in the space you occupied when you disappeared. You remain imprisoned until you are found and removed from the sphere. You can't be located by any divination magic, but a wish spell can reveal the location of your prison. You draw no more cards.

&lt;b&gt;Euryale.&lt;/b&gt; The card's medusa-like visage curses you. You take a -2 penalty on saving throws while cursed in this way. Only a god or the magic of The Fates card can end this curse.

&lt;b&gt;The Fates.&lt;/b&gt; Reality's fabric unravels and spins anew, allowing you to avoid or erase one event as if it never happened. You can use the card's magic as soon as you draw the card or at any other time before you die.

&lt;b&gt;Flames.&lt;/b&gt; A powerful devil becomes your enemy. The devil seeks your ruin and plagues your life, savoring your suffering before attempting to slay you. This enmity lasts until either you or the devil dies.

&lt;b&gt;Fool.&lt;/b&gt; You lose 10,000 XP, discard this card, and draw from the deck again, counting both draws as one of your declared draws. If losing that much XP would cause you to lose a level, you instead lose an amount that leaves you with just enough XP to keep your level.

&lt;b&gt;Gem.&lt;/b&gt; Twenty-five pieces of jewelry worth 2,000 gp each or fifty gems worth 1,000 gp each appear at your feet.

&lt;b&gt;Idiot.&lt;/b&gt; Permanently reduce your Intelligence by 1d4 + 1 (to a minimum score of 1). You can draw one additional card beyond your declared draws.

&lt;b&gt;Jester.&lt;/b&gt; You gain 10,000 XP, or you can draw two additional cards beyond your declared draws.

&lt;b&gt;Key.&lt;/b&gt; A rare or rarer magic weapon with which you are proficient appears in your hands. The GM chooses the weapon.

&lt;b&gt;Knight.&lt;/b&gt; You gain the service of a 4th-level fighter who appears in a space you choose within 30 feet of you. The fighter is of the same race as you and serves you loyally until death, believing the fates have drawn him or her to you. You control this character.

&lt;b&gt;Moon.&lt;/b&gt; You are granted the ability to cast the &lt;b&gt;wish&lt;/b&gt; spell 1d3 times.

&lt;b&gt;Rogue.&lt;/b&gt; A nonplayer character of the GM's choice becomes hostile toward you. The identity of your new enemy isn't known until the NPC or someone else reveals it. Nothing less than a &lt;b&gt;wish&lt;/b&gt; spell or divine intervention can end the NPC's hostility toward you.

&lt;b&gt;Ruin.&lt;/b&gt; All forms of wealth that you carry or own, other than magic items, are lost to you. Portable property vanishes. Businesses, buildings, and land you own are lost in a way that alters reality the least. Any documentation that proves you should own something lost to this card also disappears.

&lt;b&gt;Skull.&lt;/b&gt; You summon an avatar of death--a ghostly humanoid skeleton clad in a tattered black robe and carrying a spectral scythe. It appears in a space of the GM's choice within 10 feet of you and attacks you, warning all others that you must win the battle alone. The avatar fights until you die or it drops to 0 hit points, whereupon it disappears. If anyone tries to help you, the helper summons its own avatar of death. A creature slain by an avatar of death can't be restored to life.

 

AVATAR OF DEATH

&lt;i&gt;Medium undead, neutral evil&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Senses&lt;/b&gt; darkvision 60 ft., truesight 60 ft., passive Perception 13

&lt;b&gt;Languages&lt;/b&gt; all languages known to its summoner

&lt;b&gt;Challenge&lt;/b&gt; -- (0 XP)

&lt;b&gt;Incorporeal Movement.&lt;/b&gt; The avatar can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.
&lt;b&gt;Turning Immunity.&lt;/b&gt; The avatar is immune to features that turn undead.

ACTIONS

&lt;b&gt;Reaping Scythe.&lt;/b&gt; The avatar sweeps its spectral scythe through a creature within 5 feet of it, dealing 7 (1d8 + 3) slashing damage plus 4 (1d8) necrotic damage.



 

&lt;b&gt;Star.&lt;/b&gt; Increase one of your ability scores by 2. The score can exceed 20 but can't exceed 24.

&lt;b&gt;Sun.&lt;/b&gt; You gain 50,000 XP, and a wondrous item (which the GM determines randomly) appears in your hands.

&lt;b&gt;Talons.&lt;/b&gt; Every magic item you wear or carry disintegrates. Artifacts in your possession aren't destroyed but do vanish.

&lt;b&gt;Throne.&lt;/b&gt; You gain proficiency in the Persuasion skill, and you double your proficiency bonus on checks made with that skill. In addition, you gain rightful ownership of a small keep somewhere in the world. However, the keep is currently in the hands of monsters, which you must clear out before you can claim the keep as yours.

&lt;b&gt;Vizier.&lt;/b&gt; At any time you choose within one year of drawing this card, you can ask a question in meditation and mentally receive a truthful answer to that question. Besides information, the answer helps you solve a puzzling problem or other dilemma. In other words, the knowledge comes with wisdom on how to apply it.

&lt;b&gt;The Void.&lt;/b&gt; This black card spells disaster. Your soul is drawn from your body and contained in an object in a place of the GM's choice. One or more powerful beings guard the place. While your soul is trapped in this way, your body is incapacitated. A wish spell can't restore your soul, but the spell reveals the location of the object that holds it. You draw no more cards.

		<text>This small packet contains 1d6 + 4 pinches of dust. You can use an action to sprinkle a pinch of it over water. The dust turns a cube of water 15 feet on a side into one marble-sized pellet, which floats or rests near where the dust was sprinkled. The pellet's weight is negligible.

Someone can use an action to smash the pellet against a hard surface, causing the pellet to shatter and release the water the dust absorbed. Doing so ends that pellet's magic.

An elemental composed mostly of water that is exposed to a pinch of the dust must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking 10d6 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

When you use an action to throw a handful of the dust into the air, you and each creature that needs to breathe within 30 feet of you must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become unable to breathe, while sneezing uncontrollably. A creature affected in this way is incapacitated and suffocating. As long as it is conscious, a creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on it on a success. The &lt;b&gt;lesser restoration&lt;/b&gt; spell can also end the effect on a creature.

		<text>This painted brass bottle weighs 1 pound. When you use an action to remove the stopper, a cloud of thick smoke flows out of the bottle. At the end of your turn, the smoke disappears with a flash of harmless fire, and an efreeti appears in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of you.

The first time the bottle is opened, the GM rolls to determine what happens.

D100    EFFECT
01-10   The efreeti attacks
        you. After fighting
        for 5 rounds, the
        efreeti disappears,
        and the bottle loses
        its magic.
11-90   The efreeti serves
        you for 1 hour,
        doing as you
        command. Then the
        efreeti returns to
        the bottle, and a
        new stopper contains
        it. The stopper
        can't be removed for
        24 hours. The next
        two times the bottle
        is opened, the same
        effect occurs. If
        the bottle is opened
        a fourth time, the
        efreeti escapes and
        disappears, and the
        bottle loses its
        magic.
91-00   The efreeti can cast
        the wish spell three
        times for you. It
        disappears when it
        grants the final
        wish or after 1
        hour, and the bottle
        loses its magic.

		<text>Smoke leaks from the lead-stoppered mouth of this brass bottle, which weighs 1 pound. When you use an action to remove the stopper, a cloud of thick smoke pours out in a 60-foot radius from the bottle. The cloud's area is heavily obscured. Each minute the bottle remains open and within the cloud, the radius increases by 10 feet until it reaches its maximum radius of 120 feet.

The cloud persists as long as the bottle is open. Closing the bottle requires you to speak its command word as an action. Once the bottle is closed, the cloud disperses after 10 minutes. A moderate wind (11 to 20 miles per hour) can also disperse the smoke after 1 minute, and a strong wind (21 or more miles per hour) can do so after 1 round.

One command word causes the box to unfold into a boat 10 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 2 feet deep. The boat has one pair of oars, an anchor, a mast, and a lateen sail. The boat can hold up to four Medium creatures comfortably.

The second command word causes the box to unfold into a ship 24 feet long, 8 feet wide, and 6 feet deep. The ship has a deck, rowing seats, five sets of oars, a steering oar, an anchor, a deck cabin, and a mast with a square sail. The ship can hold fifteen Medium creatures comfortably.

When the box becomes a vessel, its weight becomes that of a normal vessel its size, and anything that was stored in the box remains in the boat.

The third command word causes the &lt;b&gt;folding boat&lt;/b&gt; to fold back into a box, provided that no creatures are aboard. Any objects in the vessel that can't fit inside the box remain outside the box as it folds. Any objects in the vessel that can fit inside the box do so.

 * The first command word causes the gem to shed bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. This effect doesn't expend a charge. It lasts until you use a bonus action to repeat the command word or until you use another function of the gem.
 * The second command word expends 1 charge and causes the gem to fire a brilliant beam of light at one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become blinded for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
 * The third command word expends 5 charges and causes the gem to flare with blinding light in a 30- foot cone originating from it. Each creature in the cone must make a saving throw as if struck by the beam created with the second command word.

When all of the gem's charges are expended, the gem becomes a nonmagical jewel worth 50 gp.

		<text>This backpack has a central pouch and two side pouches, each of which is an extradimensional space. Each side pouch can hold up to 20 pounds of material, not exceeding a volume of 2 cubic feet. The large central pouch can hold up to 8 cubic feet or 80 pounds of material. The backpack always weighs 5 pounds, regardless of its contents.

Placing an object in the haversack follows the normal rules for interacting with objects. Retrieving an item from the haversack requires you to use an action. When you reach into the haversack for a specific item, the item is always magically on top.

The haversack has a few limitations. If it is overloaded, or if a sharp object pierces it or tears it, the haversack ruptures and is destroyed. If the haversack is destroyed, its contents are lost forever, although an artifact always turns up again somewhere. If the haversack is turned inside out, its contents spill forth, unharmed, and the haversack must be put right before it can be used again. If a breathing creature is placed within the haversack, the creature can survive for up to 10 minutes, after which time it begins to suffocate.

Placing the haversack inside an extradimensional space created by a &lt;b&gt;bag of holding&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;portable hole&lt;/b&gt;, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it and deposited in a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can't be reopened.

		<text>This dazzling helm is set with 1d10 diamonds, 2d10 rubies, 3d10 fire opals, and 4d10 opals. Any gem pried from the helm crumbles to dust. When all the gems are removed or destroyed, the helm loses its magic.

You gain the following benefits while wearing it:

 * You can use an action to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18), using one of the helm's gems of the specified type as a component: &lt;b&gt;daylight &lt;/b&gt;(opal), &lt;b&gt;fireball&lt;/b&gt; (fire opal), &lt;b&gt;prismatic spray&lt;/b&gt; (diamond), or &lt;b&gt;wall of fire&lt;/b&gt; (ruby). The gem is destroyed when the spell is cast and disappears from the helm.
 * As long as it has at least one diamond, the helm emits dim light in a 30-foot radius when at least one undead is within that area. Any undead that starts its turn in that area takes 1d6 radiant damage.
 * As long as the helm has at least one ruby, you have resistance to fire damage.
 * As long as the helm has at least one fire opal, you can use an action and speak a command word to cause one weapon you are holding to burst into flames. The flames emit bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. The flames are harmless to you and the weapon. When you hit with an attack using the blazing weapon, the target takes an extra 1d6 fire damage. The flames last until you use a bonus action to speak the command word again or until you drop or stow the weapon.

Roll a d20 if you are wearing the helm and take fire damage as a result of failing a saving throw against a spell. On a roll of 1, the helm emits beams of light from its remaining gems. Each creature within 60 feet of the helm other than you must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or be struck by a beam, taking radiant damage equal to the number of gems in the helm. The helm and its gems are then destroyed.

Each creature in the cone must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 5d6 thunder damage and is deafened for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't deafened. Creatures and objects made of glass or crystal have disadvantage on the saving throw and take 10d6 thunder damage instead of 5d6.

Each use of the horn's magic has a 20 percent chance of causing the horn to explode. The explosion deals 10d6 fire damage to the blower and destroys the horn.

		<text>You can use an action to place this 1-inch metal cube on the ground and speak its command word. The cube rapidly grows into a fortress that remains until you use an action to speak the command word that dismisses it, which works only if the fortress is empty.

The fortress is a square tower, 20 feet on a side and 30 feet high, with arrow slits on all sides and a battlement atop it. Its interior is divided into two floors, with a ladder running along one wall to connect them. The ladder ends at a trapdoor leading to the roof. When activated, the tower has a small door on the side facing you. The door opens only at your command, which you can speak as a bonus action. It is immune to the &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;knock&lt;/b&gt; spell and similar magic, such as that of a &lt;b&gt;chime of opening&lt;/b&gt;.

Each creature in the area where the fortress appears must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10d10 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. In either case, the creature is pushed to an unoccupied space outside but next to the fortress. Objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried take this damage and are pushed automatically.

The tower is made of adamantine, and its magic prevents it from being tipped over. The roof, the door, and the walls each have 100 hit points, immunity to damage from nonmagical weapons excluding siege weapons, and resistance to all other damage. Only a &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;wish&lt;/b&gt; spell can repair the fortress (this use of the spell counts as replicating a spell of 8th level or lower). Each casting of &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;wish&lt;/b&gt; causes the roof, the door, or one wall to regain 50 hit points.

		<text>This rusty iron sphere measures 3 inches in diameter and weighs 1 pound. You can use an action to speak the command word and throw the sphere at a Huge or smaller creature you can see within 60 feet of you. As the sphere moves through the air, it opens into a tangle of metal bands.

Make a ranged attack roll with an attack bonus equal to your Dexterity modifier plus your proficiency bonus. On a hit, the target is restrained until you take a bonus action to speak the command word again to release it. Doing so, or missing with the attack, causes the bands to contract and become a sphere once more.

A creature, including the one restrained, can use an action to make a DC 20 Strength check to break the iron bands. On a success, the item is destroyed, and the restrained creature is freed. If the check fails, any further attempts made by that creature automatically fail until 24 hours have elapsed.

Once the bands are used, they can't be used again until the next dawn.

		<text>This iron bottle has a brass stopper. You can use an action to speak the flask's command word, targeting a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you. If the target is native to a plane of existence other than the one you're on, the target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be trapped in the flask. If the target has been trapped by the flask before, it has advantage on the saving throw. Once trapped, a creature remains in the flask until released. The flask can hold only one creature at a time. A creature trapped in the flask doesn't need to breathe, eat, or drink and doesn't age.

You can use an action to remove the flask's stopper and release the creature the flask contains. The creature is friendly to you and your companions for 1 hour and obeys your commands for that duration. If you give no commands or give it a command that is likely to result in its death, it defends itself but otherwise takes no actions. At the end of the duration, the creature acts in accordance with its normal disposition and alignment.

An identify spell reveals that a creature is inside the flask, but the only way to determine the type of creature is to open the flask. A newly discovered bottle might already contain a creature chosen by the GM or determined randomly.

		<text>Typically found in 1d4 pots inside a fine wooden box with a brush (weighing 1 pound in total), these pigments allow you to create three-dimensional objects by painting them in two dimensions. The paint flows from the brush to form the desired object as you concentrate on its image.

Each pot of paint is sufficient to cover 1,000 square feet of a surface, which lets you create inanimate objects or terrain features--such as a door, a pit, flowers, trees, cells, rooms, or weapons-- that are up to 10,000 cubic feet. It takes 10 minutes to cover 100 square feet.

When you complete the painting, the object or terrain feature depicted becomes a real, nonmagical object. Thus, painting a door on a wall creates an actual door that can be opened to whatever is beyond. Painting a pit on a floor creates a real pit, and its depth counts against the total area of objects you create.

Nothing created by the pigments can have a value greater than 25 gp. If you paint an object of greater value (such as a diamond or a pile of gold), the object looks authentic, but close inspection reveals it is made from paste, bone, or some other worthless material.

If you paint a form of energy such as fire or lightning, the energy appears but dissipates as soon as you complete the painting, doing no harm to anything.

		<text>When this 4-foot-tall mirror is viewed indirectly, its surface shows faint images of creatures. The mirror weighs 50 pounds, and it has AC 11, 10 hit points, and vulnerability to bludgeoning damage. It shatters and is destroyed when reduced to 0 hit points.

If the mirror is hanging on a vertical surface and you are within 5 feet of it, you can use an action to speak its command word and activate it. It remains activated until you use an action to speak the command word again.

Any creature other than you that sees its reflection in the activated mirror while within 30 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be trapped, along with anything it is wearing or carrying, in one of the mirror's twelve extradimensional cells. This saving throw is made with advantage if the creature knows the mirror's nature, and constructs succeed on the saving throw automatically.

An extradimensional cell is an infinite expanse filled with thick fog that reduces visibility to 10 feet. Creatures trapped in the mirror's cells don't age, and they don't need to eat, drink, or sleep. A creature trapped within a cell can escape using magic that permits planar travel. Otherwise, the creature is confined to the cell until freed.

If the mirror traps a creature but its twelve extradimensional cells are already occupied, the mirror frees one trapped creature at random to accommodate the new prisoner. A freed creature appears in an unoccupied space within sight of the mirror but facing away from it. If the mirror is shattered, all creatures it contains are freed and appear in unoccupied spaces near it.

While within 5 feet of the mirror, you can use an action to speak the name of one creature trapped in it or call out a particular cell by number. The creature named or contained in the named cell appears as an image on the mirror's surface. You and the creature can then communicate normally.

In a similar way, you can use an action to speak a second command word and free one creature trapped in the mirror. The freed creature appears, along with its possessions, in the unoccupied space nearest to the mirror and facing away from it.

Six types of magic beads exist. The GM decides the type of each bead on the necklace or determines it randomly. A necklace can have more than one bead of the same type. To use one, you must be wearing the necklace. Each bead contains a spell that you can cast from it as a bonus action (using your spell save DC if a save is necessary). Once a magic bead's spell is cast, that bead can't be used again until the next dawn.

When you use this weapon to make a ranged attack, you can, as a command phrase, say, "Swift death to you who have wronged me." The target of your attack becomes your sworn enemy until it dies or until dawn seven days later. You can have only one such sworn enemy at a time.

		<name>Orb of Dragonkind</name>

		<value/>

		<rarity>Artifact</rarity>
		<attunement>requires attunement</attunement>
		<type>W</type>
		<text>Ages past, elves and humans waged a terrible war against evil dragons. When the world seemed doomed, powerful wizards came together and worked their greatest magic, forging five &lt;i&gt;Orbs of Dragonkind&lt;/i&gt; (or &lt;i&gt;Dragon Orbs&lt;/i&gt;) to help them defeat the dragons. One orb was taken to each of the five wizard towers, and there they were used to speed the war toward a victorious end. The wizards used the orbs to lure dragons to them, then destroyed the dragons with powerful magic.

As the wizard towers fell in later ages, the orbs were destroyed or faded into legend, and only three are thought to survive. Their magic has been warped and twisted over the centuries, so although their primary purpose of calling dragons still functions, they also allow some measure of control over dragons.

Each orb contains the essence of an evil dragon, a presence that resents any attempt to coax magic from it. Those lacking in force of personality might find themselves enslaved to an orb.

An orb is an etched crystal globe about 10 inches in diameter. When used, it grows to about 20 inches in diameter, and mist swirls inside it.

While attuned to an orb, you can use an action to peer into the orb’s depths and speak its command word. You must then make a DC 15 Charisma check. On a successful check, you control the orb for as long as you remain attuned to it. On a failed check, you become charmed by the orb for as long as you remain attuned to it.

While you are charmed by the orb, you can’t voluntarily end your attunement to it, and the orb casts suggestion on you at will (save DC 18), urging you to work toward the evil ends it desires. The dragon essence within the orb might want many things: the annihilation of a particular people, freedom from the orb, to spread suffering in the world, to advance the worship of Tiamat, or something else the GM decides.

RANDOM PROPERTIES

An &lt;i&gt;Orb of Dragonkind&lt;/i&gt; has the following random properties:

 * 2 minor beneficial properties
 * 1 minor detrimental property
 * 1 major detrimental property

SPELLS

The orb has 7 charges and regains 1d4 + 3 expended charges daily at dawn. If you control the orb, you can use an action and expend 1 or more charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from it: cure wounds (5th-level version, 3 charges), daylight (1 charge), death ward (2 charges), or scrying (3 charges).

You can also use an action to cast the detect magic spell from the orb without using any charges.

CALL DRAGONS

While you control the orb, you can use an action to cause the artifact to issue a telepathic call that extends in all directions for 40 miles. Evil dragons in range feel compelled to come to the orb as soon as possible by the most direct route. Dragon deities such as Tiamat are unaffected by this call. Dragons drawn to the orb might be hostile toward you for compelling them against their will. Once you have used this property, it can’t be used again for 1 hour.

DESTROYING AN ORB

An &lt;i&gt;Orb of Dragonkind&lt;/i&gt; appears fragile but is impervious to most damage, including the attacks and breath weapons of dragons. A disintegrate spell or one good hit from a +3 magic weapon is sufficient to destroy an orb, however.

The pipes have 3 charges. If you play the pipes as an action, you can use a bonus action to expend 1 to 3 charges, calling forth one swarm of rats with each expended charge, provided that enough rats are within half a mile of you to be called in this fashion (as determined by the GM). If there aren't enough rats to form a swarm, the charge is wasted. Called swarms move toward the music by the shortest available route but aren't under your control otherwise. The pipes regain 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.

Whenever a swarm of rats that isn't under another creature's control comes within 30 feet of you while you are playing the pipes, you can make a Charisma check contested by the swarm's Wisdom check. If you lose the contest, the swarm behaves as it normally would and can't be swayed by the pipes' music for the next 24 hours. If you win the contest, the swarm is swayed by the pipes' music and becomes friendly to you and your companions for as long as you continue to play the pipes each round as an action. A friendly swarm obeys your commands. If you issue no commands to a friendly swarm, it defends itself but otherwise takes no actions. If a friendly swarm starts its turn and can't hear the pipes' music, your control over that swarm ends, and the swarm behaves as it normally would and can't be swayed by the pipes' music for the next 24 hours.

		<text>This fine black cloth, soft as silk, is folded up to the dimensions of a handkerchief. It unfolds into a circular sheet 6 feet in diameter.

You can use an action to unfold a &lt;i&gt;portable hole&lt;/i&gt; and place it on or against a solid surface, whereupon the &lt;i&gt;portable hole&lt;/i&gt; creates an extradimensional hole 10 feet deep. The cylindrical space within the hole exists on a different plane, so it can’t be used to create open passages. Any creature inside an open &lt;i&gt;portable hole&lt;/i&gt; can exit the hole by climbing out of it.

You can use an action to close a &lt;i&gt;portable hole&lt;/i&gt; by taking hold of the edges of the cloth and folding it up. Folding the cloth closes the hole, and any creatures or objects within remain in the extradimensional space. No matter what’s in it, the hole weighs next to nothing.

If the hole is folded up, a creature within the hole’s extradimensional space can use an action to make a DC 10 Strength check. On a successful check, the creature forces its way out and appears within 5 feet of the &lt;i&gt;portable hole&lt;/i&gt; or the creature carrying it. A breathing creature within a closed &lt;i&gt;portable hole&lt;/i&gt; can survive for up to 10 minutes, after which time it begins to suffocate.

Placing a &lt;i&gt;portable hole&lt;/i&gt; inside an extradimensional space created by a bag of holding, handy haversack, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it and deposited in a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can’t be reopened.

It remains as long as you concentrate (as if concentrating on a spell), to a maximum of 1 hour, or until it drops to 0 hit points. It then returns to its home plane.

While summoned, the djinni is friendly to you and your companions. It obeys any commands you give it, no matter what language you use. If you fail to command it, the djinni defends itself against attackers but takes no other actions.

After the djinni departs, it can't be summoned again for 24 hours, and the ring becomes nonmagical if the djinni dies.

		<text>While wearing this ring in dim light or darkness, you can cast &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;dancing lights&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;light&lt;/b&gt; from the ring at will. Casting either spell from the ring requires an action.

The ring has 6 charges for the following other properties. The ring regains 1d6 expended charges daily at dawn.

&lt;b&gt;Faerie Fire.&lt;/b&gt; You can expend 1 charge as an action to cast &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;faerie fire&lt;/b&gt; from the ring.

&lt;b&gt;Ball Lightning.&lt;/b&gt; You can expend 2 charges as an action to create one to four 3-foot-diameter spheres of lightning. The more spheres you create, the less powerful each sphere is individually.

Each sphere appears in an unoccupied space you can see within 120 feet of you. The spheres last as long as you concentrate (as if concentrating on a spell), up to 1 minute. Each sphere sheds dim light in a 30-foot radius.

As a bonus action, you can move each sphere up to 30 feet, but no farther than 120 feet away from you. When a creature other than you comes within 5 feet of a sphere, the sphere discharges lightning at that creature and disappears. That creature must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes lightning damage based on the number of spheres you created.



SPHERES   LIGHTNING DAMAGE
4         2d4
3         2d6
2         5d4
1         4d12

 

&lt;b&gt;Shooting Stars.&lt;/b&gt; You can expend 1 to 3 charges as an action. For every charge you expend, you launch a glowing mote of light from the ring at a point you can see within 60 feet of you. Each creature within a 15-foot cube originating from that point is showered in sparks and must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 5d4 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

		<text>This ring stores spells cast into it, holding them until the attuned wearer uses them. The ring can store up to 5 levels worth of spells at a time. When found, it contains 1d6 - 1 levels of stored spells chosen by the GM.

Any creature can cast a spell of 1st through 5th level into the ring by touching the ring as the spell is cast. The spell has no effect, other than to be stored in the ring. If the ring can't hold the spell, the spell is expended without effect. The level of the slot used to cast the spell determines how much space it uses.

While wearing this ring, you can cast any spell stored in it. The spell uses the slot level, spell save DC, spell attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the original caster, but is otherwise treated as if you cast the spell. The spell cast from the ring is no longer stored in it, freeing up space.

		<text>While holding this rod, you can use your reaction to absorb a spell that is targeting only you and not with an area of effect. The absorbed spell's effect is canceled, and the spell's energy -- not the spell itself -- is stored in the rod. The energy has the same level as the spell when it was cast. The rod can absorb and store up to 50 levels of energy over the course of its existence. Once the rod absorbs 50 levels of energy, it can't absorb more. If you are targeted by a spell that the rod can't store, the rod has no effect on that spell.

When you become attuned to the rod, you know how many levels of energy the rod has absorbed over the course of its existence, and how many levels of spell energy it currently has stored.

If you are a spellcaster holding the rod, you can convert energy stored in it into spell slots to cast spells you have prepared or know. You can create spell slots only of a level equal to or lower than your own spell slots, up to a maximum of 5th level. You use the stored levels in place of your slots, but otherwise cast the spell as normal. For example, you can use 3 levels stored in the rod as a 3rd-level spell slot.

A newly found rod has 1d10 levels of spell energy stored in it already. A rod that can no longer absorb spell energy and has no energy remaining becomes nonmagical.

		<text>This rod has a flanged head, and it functions as a magic mace that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. The rod has properties associated with six different buttons that are set in a row along the haft. It has three other properties as well, detailed below.

&lt;b&gt;Six Buttons.&lt;/b&gt; You can press one of the rod's six buttons as a bonus action. A button's effect lasts until you push a different button or until you push the same button again, which causes the rod to revert to its normal form.

If you press &lt;b&gt;button 1&lt;/b&gt;, the rod becomes a flame tongue, as a fiery blade sprouts from the end opposite the rod's flanged head (you choose the type of sword).

If you press &lt;b&gt;button 2&lt;/b&gt;, the rod's flanged head folds down and two crescent-shaped blades spring out, transforming the rod into a magic battleaxe that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.

If you press &lt;b&gt;button 3&lt;/b&gt;, the rod's flanged head folds down, a spear point springs from the rod's tip, and the rod's handle lengthens into a 6-foot haft, transforming the rod into a magic spear that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.

If you press &lt;b&gt;button 4&lt;/b&gt;, the rod transforms into a climbing pole up to 50 feet long, as you specify. In surfaces as hard as granite, a spike at the bottom and three hooks at the top anchor the pole. Horizontal bars 3 inches long fold out from the sides, 1 foot apart, forming a ladder. The pole can bear up to 4,000 pounds. More weight or lack of solid anchoring causes the rod to revert to its normal form.

If you press &lt;b&gt;button 5&lt;/b&gt;, the rod transforms into a handheld battering ram and grants its user a +10 bonus to Strength checks made to break through doors, barricades, and other barriers.

If you press &lt;b&gt;button 6&lt;/b&gt;, the rod assumes or remains in its normal form and indicates magnetic north. (Nothing happens if this function of the rod is used in a location that has no magnetic north.) The rod also gives you knowledge of your approximate depth beneath the ground or your height above it.

&lt;b&gt;Drain Life.&lt;/b&gt; When you hit a creature with a melee attack using the rod, you can force the target to make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the target takes an extra 4d6 necrotic damage, and you regain a number of hit points equal to half that necrotic damage. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.

&lt;b&gt;Paralyze.&lt;/b&gt; When you hit a creature with a melee attack using the rod, you can force the target to make a DC 17 Strength saving throw. On a failure, the target is paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.

&lt;b&gt;Terrify.&lt;/b&gt; While holding the rod, you can use an action to force each creature you can see within 30 feet of you to make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, a target is frightened of you for 1 minute. A frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.

Each target must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you for 8 hours. While charmed in this way, the creature regards you as its trusted leader. If harmed by you or your companions, or commanded to do something contrary to its nature, a target ceases to be charmed in this way. The rod can't be used again until the next dawn.

		<text>While holding this rod, you can use an action to activate it. The rod then instantly transports you and up to 199 other willing creatures you can see to a paradise that exists in an extraplanar space. You choose the form that the paradise takes. It could be a tranquil garden, lovely glade, cheery tavern, immense palace, tropical island, fantastic carnival, or whatever else you can imagine. Regardless of its nature, the paradise contains enough water and food to sustain its visitors. Everything else that can be interacted with inside the extraplanar space can exist only there. For example, a flower picked from a garden in the paradise disappears if it is taken outside the extraplanar space.

For each hour spent in the paradise, a visitor regains hit points as if it had spent 1 Hit Die. Also, creatures don't age while in the paradise, although time passes normally. Visitors can remain in the paradise for up to 200 days divided by the number of creatures present (round down).

When the time runs out or you use an action to end it, all visitors reappear in the location they occupied when you activated the rod, or an unoccupied space nearest that location. The rod can't be used again until ten days have passed.

		<text>This 60-foot length of silk rope weighs 3 pounds and can hold up to 3,000 pounds. If you hold one end of the rope and use an action to speak the command word, the rope animates. As a bonus action, you can command the other end to move toward a destination you choose. That end moves 10 feet on your turn when you first command it and 10 feet on each of your turns until reaching its destination, up to its maximum length away, or until you tell it to stop. You can also tell the rope to fasten itself securely to an object or to unfasten itself, to knot or unknot itself, or to coil itself for carrying.

If you tell the rope to knot, large knots appear at 1- foot intervals along the rope. While knotted, the rope shortens to a 50-foot length and grants advantage on checks made to climb it.

The rope has AC 20 and 20 hit points. It regains 1 hit point every 5 minutes as long as it has at least 1 hit point. If the rope drops to 0 hit points, it is destroyed.

You can release the creature by using a bonus action to speak a second command word. A target restrained by the rope can use an action to make a DC 15 Strength or Dexterity check (target’s choice). On a success, the creature is no longer restrained by the rope.

The rope has AC 20 and 20 hit points. It regains 1 hit point every 5 minutes as long as it has at least 1 hit point. If the rope drops to 0 hit points, it is destroyed.

		<weight/>
		<rarity>Legendary</rarity>
		<type>W</type>
		<text>This 2-foot-diameter black sphere is a hole in the multiverse, hovering in space and stabilized by a magical field surrounding it.

The sphere obliterates all matter it passes through and all matter that passes through it. Artifacts are the exception. Unless an artifact is susceptible to damage from a &lt;b&gt;sphere of annihilation&lt;/b&gt;, it passes through the sphere unscathed. Anything else that touches the sphere but isn't wholly engulfed and obliterated by it takes 4d10 force damage.

The sphere is stationary until someone controls it. If you are within 60 feet of an uncontrolled sphere, you can use an action to make a DC 25 Intelligence (Arcana) check. On a success, the sphere levitates in one direction of your choice, up to a number of feet equal to 5 × your Intelligence modifier (minimum 5 feet). On a failure, the sphere moves 10 feet toward you. A creature whose space the sphere enters must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be touched by it, taking 4d10 force damage.

If you attempt to control a sphere that is under another creature's control, you make an Intelligence (Arcana) check contested by the other creature's Intelligence (Arcana) check. The winner of the contest gains control of the sphere and can levitate it as normal.

If the sphere comes into contact with a planar portal, such as that created by the &lt;b&gt;gate&lt;/b&gt; spell, or an extradimensional space, such as that within a &lt;b&gt;portable hole&lt;/b&gt;, the GM determines randomly what happens, using the following table.



D100    RESULT
01-50   The sphere is
        destroyed.
51-85   The sphere moves
        through the portal
        or into the
        extradimensional
        space.
86-00   A spatial rift sends
        each creature and
        object within 180
        feet of the sphere,
        including the
        sphere, to a random
        plane of existence.

&lt;b&gt;Retributive Strike.&lt;/b&gt; You can use an action to break the staff over your knee or against a solid surface, performing a retributive strike. The staff is destroyed and releases its remaining magic in an explosion that expands to fill a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on it.

You have a 50 percent chance to instantly travel to a random plane of existence, avoiding the explosion. If you fail to avoid the effect, you take force damage equal to 16 × the number of charges in the staff. Every other creature in the area must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes an amount of damage based on how far away it is from the point of origin, as shown in the following table. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage.



DISTANCE FROM ORIGIN   DAMAGE
10 ft. away or         8 x the number of

11 to 20 ft. away      6 x the number of

The staff has 10 charges. When you hit with a melee attack using it, you can expend up to 3 of its charges. For each charge you expend, the target takes an extra 1d6 force damage. The staff regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff becomes a nonmagical quarterstaff.

		<text>This staff has 10 charges and regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, a swarm of insects consumes and destroys the staff, then disperses.

&lt;b&gt;Spells.&lt;/b&gt; While holding the staff, you can use an action to expend some of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC: &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;giant insect&lt;/b&gt; (4 charges) or &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;insect plague&lt;/b&gt; (5 charges).

&lt;b&gt;Insect Cloud.&lt;/b&gt; While holding the staff, you can use an action and expend 1 charge to cause a swarm of harmless flying insects to spread out in a 30-foot radius from you. The insects remain for 10 minutes, making the area heavily obscured for creatures other than you. The swarm moves with you, remaining centered on you. A wind of at least 10 miles per hour disperses the swarm and ends the effect.

		<text>This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. While you hold it, you gain a +2 bonus to spell attack rolls.

The staff has 50 charges for the following properties. It regains 4d6 + 2 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 20, the staff regains 1d12 + 1 charges.

&lt;b&gt;Spell Absorption.&lt;/b&gt; While holding the staff, you have advantage on saving throws against spells. In addition, you can use your reaction when another creature casts a spell that targets only you. If you do, the staff absorbs the magic of the spell, canceling its effect and gaining a number of charges equal to the absorbed spell's level. However, if doing so brings the staff's total number of charges above 50, the staff explodes as if you activated its retributive strike (see below).

&lt;b&gt;Spells.&lt;/b&gt; While holding the staff, you can use an action to expend some of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC and spellcasting ability: &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;conjure elemental&lt;/b&gt; (7 charges), &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;dispel magic&lt;/b&gt; (3 charges), &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;fireball&lt;/b&gt; (7th-level version, 7 charges), &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;flaming sphere&lt;/b&gt; (2 charges), &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;ice storm&lt;/b&gt; (4 charges), &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;invisibility&lt;/b&gt; (2 charges), &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;knock&lt;/b&gt; (2 charges), &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;lightning bolt&lt;/b&gt; (7th-level version, 7 charges), &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;passwall&lt;/b&gt; (5 charges), &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;plane shift&lt;/b&gt; (7 charges), &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;telekinesis&lt;/b&gt; (5 charges), &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;wall of fire&lt;/b&gt; (4 charges), or &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;web&lt;/b&gt; (2 charges).

You can also use an action to cast one of the following spells from the staff without using any charges: &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;arcane lock&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;detect magic&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;enlarge/reduce&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;light&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;mage hand&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;protection from evil and good&lt;/b&gt;.

&lt;b&gt;Retributive Strike.&lt;/b&gt; You can use an action to break the staff over your knee or against a solid surface, performing a retributive strike. The staff is destroyed and releases its remaining magic in an explosion that expands to fill a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on it.

You have a 50 percent chance to instantly travel to a random plane of existence, avoiding the explosion. If you fail to avoid the effect, you take force damage equal to 16 × the number of charges in the staff. Every other creature in the area must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes an amount of damage based on how far away it is from the point of origin, as shown in the following table. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage.



DISTANCE FROM ORIGIN   DAMAGE
10 ft. away or         8 x the number of
closer                 charges in the staff
11 to 20 ft. away      6 x the number of
                       charges in the staff
21 to 30 ft. away      4 x the number of
                       charges in the staff

		<text>You can use an action to speak this staff's command word and throw the staff on the ground within 10 feet of you. The staff becomes a giant constrictor snake under your control and acts on its own initiative count. By using a bonus action to speak the command word again, you return the staff to its normal form in a space formerly occupied by the snake.

On your turn, you can mentally command the snake if it is within 60 feet of you and you aren't incapacitated. You decide what action the snake takes and where it moves during its next turn, or you can issue it a general command, such as to attack your enemies or guard a location.

If the snake is reduced to 0 hit points, it dies and reverts to its staff form. The staff then shatters and is destroyed. If the snake reverts to staff form before losing all its hit points, it regains all of them.

The staff has 10 charges for the following properties. It regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff loses its properties and becomes a nonmagical quarterstaff.

SPELLS

You can use an action to expend 1 or more of the staff's charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC:

 * animal friendship (1 charge)
 * awaken (5 charges)
 * barkskin (2 charges)
 * locate animals or plants (2 charges)
 * speak with animals (1 charge)
 * speak with plants (3 charges)
 * wall of thorns (6 charges).

You can also use an action to cast the pass without trace spell from the staff without using any charges.

&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tree Form.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; You can use an action to plant one end of the staff in fertile earth and expend 1 charge to transform the staff into a healthy tree. The tree is 60 feet tall and has a 5-foot-diameter trunk, and its branches at the top spread out in a 20-foot radius. The tree appears ordinary but radiates a faint aura of transmutation magic if targeted by detect magic. While touching the tree and using another action to speak its command word, you return the staff to its normal form. Any creature in the tree falls when it reverts to a staff.

&lt;b&gt;Lightning.&lt;/b&gt; When you hit with a melee attack using the staff, you can cause the target to take an extra 2d6 lightning damage.

&lt;b&gt;Thunder.&lt;/b&gt; When you hit with a melee attack using the staff, you can cause the staff to emit a crack of thunder, audible out to 300 feet. The target you hit must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or become stunned until the end of your next turn.

&lt;b&gt;Lightning Strike.&lt;/b&gt; You can use an action to cause a bolt of lightning to leap from the staff's tip in a line that is 5 feet wide and 120 feet long. Each creature in that line must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 9d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

&lt;b&gt;Thunderclap.&lt;/b&gt; You can use an action to cause the staff to issue a deafening thunderclap, audible out to 600 feet. Each creature within 60 feet of you (not including you) must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d6 thunder damage and becomes deafened for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half damage and isn't deafened.

&lt;b&gt;Thunder and Lightning.&lt;/b&gt; You can use an action to use the Lightning Strike and Thunderclap properties at the same time. Doing so doesn't expend the daily use of those properties, only the use of this one.

&lt;b&gt;Assisted Escape.&lt;/b&gt; While holding the wand, you can use your reaction to expend 1 charge and gain advantage on a saving throw you make to avoid being paralyzed or restrained, or you can expend 1 charge and gain advantage on any check you make to escape a grapple.

		<text>This wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can use an action and expend 1 charge to speak its command word. For the next minute, you know the direction of the nearest creature hostile to you within 60 feet, but not its distance from you. The wand can sense the presence of hostile creatures that are ethereal, invisible, disguised, or hidden, as well as those in plain sight. The effect ends if you stop holding the wand.

The wand regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.

&lt;b&gt;Command.&lt;/b&gt; While holding the wand, you can use an action to expend 1 charge and command another creature to flee or grovel, as with the &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;command&lt;/b&gt; spell (save DC 15).

&lt;b&gt;Cone of Fear.&lt;/b&gt; While holding the wand, you can use an action to expend 2 charges, causing the wand's tip to emit a 60-foot cone of amber light. Each creature in the cone must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you for 1 minute. While it is frightened in this way, a creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If it has nowhere it can move, the creature can use the Dodge action. At the end of each of its turns, a creature can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

		<text>This wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges and choose a target within 120 feet of you. The target can be a creature, an object, or a point in space. Roll d100 and consult the following table to discover what happens.

If the effect causes you to cast a spell from the wand, the spell's save DC is 15. If the spell normally has a range expressed in feet, its range becomes 120 feet if it isn't already. If an effect covers an area, you must center the spell on and include the target. If an effect has multiple possible subjects, the GM randomly determines which ones are affected.
The wand regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand crumbles into dust and is destroyed.



D100    EFFECT
01-05   You cast
        &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;slow&lt;/b&gt;.
06-10   You cast
        &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;faerie
        fire&lt;/b&gt;.
11-15   You are stunned
        until the start of
        your next turn,
        believing something
        awesome just
        happened.
16-20   You cast
        &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;gust of
        wind&lt;/b&gt;.
21-25   You cast
        &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;detect
        thoughts&lt;/b&gt; on the
        target you chose. If
        you didn't target a
        creature, you
        instead take 1d6
        psychic damage.
26-30   You cast
        &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;stinking
        cloud&lt;/b&gt;.
31-33   Heavy rain falls in
        a 60-foot radius
        centered on the
        target. The area
        becomes lightly
        obscured. The rain
        falls until the
        start of your next
        turn.
34-36   An animal appears in
        the unoccupied space
        nearest the target.
        The animal isn't
        under your control
        and acts as it
        normally would. Roll
        a d100 to determine
        which animal
        appears. On a 01-25,
        a rhinoceros
        appears; on a 26-50,
        an elephant appears;
        and on a 51-100, a
        rat appears.
37-46   You cast
        &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;lightning
        bolt&lt;/b&gt;.
47-49   A cloud of 600
        oversized
        butterflies fills a
        30-foot radius
        centered on the
        target. The area
        becomes heavily
        obscured. The
        butterflies remain
        for 10 minutes.
50-53   You enlarge the
        target as if you had
        cast
        &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;enlarge/reduce&lt;/b&gt;.
        If the target can't
        be affected by that
        spell, or if you
        didn't target a
        creature, you become
        the target.
54-58   You cast
        &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;darkness&lt;/b&gt;.
59-62   Grass grows on the
        ground in a 60-foot
        radius centered on
        the target. If grass
        is already there, it
        grows to ten times
        its normal size and
        remains overgrown
        for 1 minute.
63-65   An object of the
        GM's choice
        disappears into the
        Ethereal Plane. The
        object must be
        neither worn nor
        carried, within 120
        feet of the target,
        and no larger than
        10 feet in any
        dimension.
66-69   You shrink yourself
        as if you had cast
        &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;enlarge/reduce&lt;/b&gt;
        on yourself.
70-79   You cast
        &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;fireball&lt;/b&gt;.
80-84   You cast
        &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;invisibility&lt;/b&gt;
        on yourself.
85-87   Leaves grow from the
        target. If you chose
        a point in space as
        the target, leaves
        sprout from the
        creature nearest to
        that point. Unless
        they are picked off,
        the leaves turn
        brown and fall off
        after 24 hours.
88-90   A stream of 1d4 × 10
        gems, each worth 1
        gp, shoots from the
        wand's tip in a line
        30 feet long and 5
        feet wide. Each gem
        deals 1 bludgeoning
        damage, and the
        total damage of the
        gems is divided
        equally among all
        creatures in the
        line.
91-95   A burst of colorful
        shimmering light
        extends from you in
        a 30-foot radius.
        You and each
        creature in the area
        that can see must
        succeed on a DC 15
        Constitution saving
        throw or become
        blinded for 1
        minute. A creature
        can repeat the
        saving throw at the
        end of each of its
        turns, ending the
        effect on itself on
        a success.
96-97   The target's skin
        turns bright blue
        for 1d10 days. If
        you chose a point in
        space, the creature
        nearest to that
        point is affected.
98-00   If you targeted a
        creature, it must
        make a DC 15
        Constitution saving
        throw. If you didn't
        target a creature,
        you become the
        target and must make
        the saving throw. If
        the saving throw
        fails by 5 or more,
        the target is
        instantly petrified.
        On any other failed
        save, the target is
        restrained and
        begins to turn to
        stone. While
        restrained in this
        way, the target must
        repeat the saving
        throw at the end of
        its next turn,
        becoming petrified
        on a failure or
        ending the effect on
        a success. The
        petrification lasts
        until the target is
        freed by the
        &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;greater
        restoration&lt;/b&gt;
        spell or similar
        magic.

		<text>You can speak the carpet's command word as an action to make the carpet hover and fly. It moves according to your spoken directions, provided that you are within 30 feet of it.

Four sizes of &lt;i&gt;carpet of flying&lt;/i&gt; exist. The DM chooses the size of a given carpet or determines it randomly.

SIZE            CAPACITY   FLYING SPEED
3 ft. x 5 ft.   200 lb.    80 feet
4 ft. x 6 ft.   400 lb.    60 feet
5 ft. x 7 ft.   600 lb.    40 feet
6 ft. x 9 ft.   800 lb.    30 feet


A carpet can carry up to twice the weight shown on the table, but it flies at half speed if it carries more than its normal capacity.

		<text>While wearing this armor, you have resistance to one of the following damage types: bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing. The GM chooses the type or determines it randomly.

&lt;b&gt;Curse.&lt;/b&gt; This armor is cursed, a fact that is revealed only when an &lt;b&gt;identify&lt;/b&gt; spell is cast on the armor or you attune to it. Attuning to the armor curses you until you are targeted by the &lt;b&gt;remove curse&lt;/b&gt; spell or similar magic; removing the armor fails to end the curse. While cursed, you have vulnerability to two of the three damage types associated with the armor (not the one to which it grants resistance).

		<text>Dragon scale mail is made of the scales of one kind of dragon. Sometimes dragons collect their cast-off scales and gift them to humanoids. Other times, hunters carefully skin and preserve the hide of a dead dragon. In either case, dragon scale mail is highly valued.

While wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC, you have advantage on saving throws against the Frightful Presence and breath weapons of dragons, and you have resistance to one damage type that is determined by the kind of a dragon that provided the scales (see the table).

Additionally, you can focus your senses as an action to magically discern the distance and direction to the closest dragon of the type of armor within 30 miles of you. This special action can't be used again until the next dawn.

As long as you remain cursed, you are unwilling to part with the axe, keeping it within reach at all times. You also have disadvantage on attack rolls with weapons other than this one, unless no foe is within 60 feet of you that you can see or hear.

Whenever a hostile creature damages you while the axe is in your possession, you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or go berserk. While berserk, you must use your action each round to attack the creature nearest to you with the axe. If you can make extra attacks as part of the Attack action, you use those extra attacks, moving to attack the next nearest creature after you fell your current target. If you have multiple possible targets, you attack one at random. You are berserk until you start your turn with no creatures within 60 feet of you that you can see or hear.

When you do so, the sword begins to hover, flies up to 30 feet, and attacks one creature of your choice within 5 feet of it. The sword uses your attack roll and ability score modifier to damage rolls.

While the sword hovers, you can use a bonus action to cause it to fly up to 30 feet to another spot within 30 feet of you. As part of the same bonus action, you can cause the sword to attack one creature within 5 feet of it.

After the hovering sword attacks for the fourth time, it flies up to 30 feet and tries to return to your hand. If you have no hand free, it falls to the ground at your feet. If the sword has no unobstructed path to you, it moves as close to you as it can and then falls to the ground. It also ceases to hover if you grasp it or move more than 30 feet away from it.

The first time you attack with the sword on each of your turns, you can transfer some or all of the sword’s bonus to your Armor Class, instead of using the bonus on any attacks that turn. For example, you could reduce the bonus to your attack and damage rolls to +1 and gain a +2 bonus to AC. The adjusted bonuses remain in effect until the start of your next turn, although you must hold the sword to gain a bonus to AC from it.

		<text>When you attack an object with this magic sword and hit, maximize your weapon damage dice against the target.

When you attack a creature with this weapon and roll a 20 on the attack roll, that target takes an extra 14 slashing damage. Then roll another d20. If you roll a 20, you lop off one of the target's limbs, with the effect of such loss determined by the GM. If the creature has no limb to sever, you lop off a portion of its body instead.

In addition, you can speak the sword's command word to cause the blade to shed bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. Speaking the command word again or sheathing the sword puts out the light.

		<text>Hit points lost to this weapon's damage can be regained only through a short or long rest, rather than by regeneration, magic, or any other means.

Once per turn, when you hit a creature with an attack using this magic weapon, you can wound the target. At the start of each of the wounded creature's turns, it takes 1d4 necrotic damage for each time you've wounded it, and it can then make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, ending the effect of all such wounds on itself on a success. Alternatively, the wounded creature, or a creature within 5 feet of it, can use an action to make a DC 15 Wisdom (Medicine) check, ending the effect of such wounds on it on a success.

The sword has 1d8 + 1 charges. If you score a critical hit against a creature that has fewer than 100 hit points, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be slain instantly as the sword tears its life force from its body (a construct or an undead is immune). The sword loses 1 charge if the creature is slain. When the sword has no charges remaining, it loses this property.

		<text>You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. In addition, the weapon ignores resistance to slashing damage.

When you attack a creature that has at least one head with this weapon and roll a 20 on the attack roll, you cut off one of the creature's heads. The creature dies if it can't survive without the lost head. A creature is immune to this effect if it is immune to slashing damage, doesn't have or need a head, has legendary actions, or the GM decides that the creature is too big for its head to be cut off with this weapon. Such a creature instead takes an extra 6d8 slashing damage from the hit.

		<slug>feather-token</slug>
		<value/>
		<weight/>
		<rarity>Rare</rarity>
		<type>W</type>
		<text>This tiny object looks like a feather. Different types of feather tokens exist, each with a different single-use effect. The DM chooses the kind of token or determines it randomly.

D100    FEATHER TOKEN
01-20   Anchor
21-35   Bird
36-50   Fan
51-65   Swan Boat
66-90   Tree
91-00   Whip

Anchor. You can use an action to touch the token to a boat or ship. For the next 24 hours, the vessel can't be moved by any means. Touching the token to the vessel again ends the effect. When the effect ends, the token disappears.

Bird. You can use an action to toss the token 5 feet into the air. The token disappears and an enormous, multicolored bird takes its place. The bird has the statistics of a roc, but it obeys your simple commands and can't attack. It can carry up to 500 pounds while flying at its maximum speed (16 miles an hour for a maximum of 144 miles per day, with a one-hour rest for every 3 hours of flying), or 1,000 pounds at half that speed. The bird disappears after flying its maximum distance for a day or if it drops to 0 hit points. You can dismiss the bird as an action.

Fan. If you are on a boat or ship, you can use an action to toss the token up to 10 feet in the air. The token disappears, and a giant flapping fan takes its place. The fan floats and creates a wind strong enough to fill the sails of one ship, increasing its speed by 5 miles per hour for 8 hours. You can dismiss the fan as an action.

Swan Boat. You can use an action to touch the token to a body of water at least 60 feet in diameter. The token disappears, and a 50-foot-long, 20-foot- wide boat shaped like a swan takes its place. The boat is self-propelled and moves across water at a speed of 6 miles per hour. You can use an action while on the boat to command it to move or to turn up to 90 degrees. The boat can carry up to thirty-two Medium or smaller creatures. A Large creature counts as four Medium creatures, while a Huge creature counts as nine. The boat remains for 24 hours and then disappears. You can dismiss the boat as an action.

Tree. You must be outdoors to use this token. You can use an action to touch it to an unoccupied space on the ground. The token disappears, and in its place a nonmagical oak tree springs into existence. The tree is 60 feet tall and has a 5-foot-diameter trunk, and its branches at the top spread out in a 20-foot radius.

Whip. You can use an action to throw the token to a point within 10 feet of you. The token disappears, and a floating whip takes its place. You can then use a bonus action to make a melee spell attack against a creature within 10 feet of the whip, with an attack bonus of +9. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 + 5 force damage.

As a bonus action on your turn, you can direct the whip to fly up to 20 feet and repeat the attack against a creature within 10 feet of it. The whip disappears after 1 hour, when you use an action to dismiss it, or when you are incapacitated or die.

		<slug>figurine-of-wondrous-power</slug>
		<value/>
		<weight/>
		<rarity>Varies</rarity>
		<type>W</type>
		<text>A &lt;b&gt;figurine of wondrous power&lt;/b&gt; is a statuette of a beast small enough to fit in a pocket. If you use an action to speak the command word and throw the figurine to a point on the ground within 60 feet of you, the figurine becomes a living creature. If the space where the creature would appear is occupied by other creatures or objects, or if there isn't enough space for the creature, the figurine doesn't become a creature.

The creature is friendly to you and your companions. It understands your languages and obeys your spoken commands. If you issue no commands, the creature defends itself but takes no other actions.

The creature exists for a duration specific to each figurine. At the end of the duration, the creature reverts to its figurine form. It reverts to a figurine early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word again while touching it. When the creature becomes a figurine again, its property can't be used again until a certain amount of time has passed, as specified in the figurine's description.

Bronze Griffon (Rare). This bronze statuette is of a griffon rampant. It can become a griffon for up to 6 hours. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 5 days have passed.

Ebony Fly (Rare). This ebony statuette is carved in the likeness of a horsefly. It can become a giant fly for up to 12 hours and can be ridden as a mount. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 2 days have passed.

Golden Lions (Rare). These gold statuettes of lions are always created in pairs. You can use one figurine or both simultaneously. Each can become a lion for up to 1 hour. Once a lion has been used, it can't be used again until 7 days have passed.

Ivory Goats (Rare). These ivory statuettes of goats are always created in sets of three. Each goat looks unique and functions differently from the others. Their properties are as follows:

 * The &lt;i&gt;goat of traveling&lt;/i&gt; can become a Large goat with the same statistics as a riding horse. It has 24 charges, and each hour or portion thereof it spends in beast form costs 1 charge. While it has charges, you can use it as often as you wish. When it runs out of charges, it reverts to a figurine and can't be used again until 7 days have passed, when it regains all its charges.
 * The &lt;i&gt;goat of travail&lt;/i&gt; becomes a giant goat for up to 3 hours. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 30 days have passed.
 * The &lt;i&gt;goat of terror&lt;/i&gt; becomes a giant goat for up to 3 hours. The goat can't attack, but you can remove its horns and use them as weapons. One horn becomes a lance, +1, and the other becomes a longsword, +2. Removing a horn requires an action, and the weapons disappear and the horns return when the goat reverts to figurine form. In addition, the goat radiates a 30-foot-radius aura of terror while you are riding it. Any creature hostile to you that starts its turn in the aura must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of the goat for 1 minute, or until the goat reverts to figurine form. The frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once it successfully saves against the effect, a creature is immune to the goat's aura for the next 24 hours. Once the figurine has been used, it can't be used again until 15 days have passed.

Marble Elephant (Rare). This marble statuette is about 4 inches high and long. It can become an elephant for up to 24 hours. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 7 days have passed.

Obsidian Steed (Very Rare). This polished obsidian horse can become a nightmare for up to 24 hours. The nightmare fights only to defend itself. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 5 days have passed.

If you have a good alignment, the figurine has a 10 percent chance each time you use it to ignore your orders, including a command to revert to figurine form. If you mount the nightmare while it is ignoring your orders, you and the nightmare are instantly transported to a random location on the plane of Hades, where the nightmare reverts to figurine form.

Onyx Dog (Rare). This onyx statuette of a dog can become a mastiff for up to 6 hours. The mastiff has an Intelligence of 8 and can speak Common. It also has darkvision out to a range of 60 feet and can see invisible creatures and objects within that range. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 7 days have passed.

Serpentine Owl (Rare). This serpentine statuette of an owl can become a giant owl for up to 8 hours. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 2 days have passed. The owl can telepathically communicate with you at any range if you and it are on the same plane of existence.

Silver Raven (Uncommon). This silver statuette of a raven can become a raven for up to 12 hours. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 2 days have passed. While in raven form, the figurine allows you to cast the animal messenger spell on it at will.

		<text>You can use an action to blow this horn. In response, warrior spirits from the Valhalla appear within 60 feet of you. They use the statistics of a berserker. They return to Valhalla after 1 hour or when they drop to 0 hit points. Once you use the horn, it can't be used again until 7 days have passed.

Four types of horn of Valhalla are known to exist, each made of a different metal. The horn's type determines how many berserkers answer its summons, as well as the requirement for its use. The GM chooses the horn's type or determines it randomly.

D100     HORN TYPE   BERSERKERS SUMMONED   REQUIREMENT
01-40    Silver      2d4 + 2               None
41-75    Brass       3d4 + 3               Proficiency with all
                                           simple weapons
76-90    Bronze      4d4 + 4               Proficiency with all
                                           medium armor

                                           martial weapons

If you blow the horn without meeting its requirement, the summoned berserkers attack you. If you meet the requirement, they are friendly to you and your companions and follow your commands.

		<text>An &lt;b&gt;Ioun stone&lt;/b&gt; is named after Ioun, a god of knowledge and prophecy revered on some worlds. Many types of &lt;b&gt;Ioun stone&lt;/b&gt; exist, each type a distinct combination of shape and color.

When you use an action to toss one of these stones into the air, the stone orbits your head at a distance of 1d3 feet and confers a benefit to you. Thereafter, another creature must use an action to grasp or net the stone to separate it from you, either by making a successful attack roll against AC 24 or a successful DC 24 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. You can use an action to seize and stow the stone, ending its effect.

A stone has AC 24, 10 hit points, and resistance to all damage. It is considered to be an object that is being worn while it orbits your head.

Absorption&lt;b&gt; (Very Rare).&lt;/b&gt; While this pale lavender ellipsoid orbits your head, you can use your reaction to cancel a spell of 4th level or lower cast by a creature you can see and targeting only you.

Once the stone has canceled 20 levels of spells, it burns out and turns dull gray, losing its magic. If you are targeted by a spell whose level is higher than the number of spell levels the stone has left, the stone can't cancel it.

Agility&lt;b&gt; (Very Rare).&lt;/b&gt; Your Dexterity score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this deep red sphere orbits your head.

Awareness&lt;b&gt; (Rare).&lt;/b&gt; You can't be surprised while this dark blue rhomboid orbits your head.

Fortitude&lt;b&gt; (Very Rare).&lt;/b&gt; Your Constitution score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this pink rhomboid orbits your head.

Greater Absorption&lt;b&gt; (Legendary).&lt;/b&gt; While this marbled lavender and green ellipsoid orbits your head, you can use your reaction to cancel a spell of 8th level or lower cast by a creature you can see and targeting only you.

Once the stone has canceled 50 levels of spells, it burns out and turns dull gray, losing its magic. If you are targeted by a spell whose level is higher than the number of spell levels the stone has left, the stone can't cancel it.

Insight &lt;b&gt;(Very Rare).&lt;/b&gt; Your Wisdom score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this incandescent blue sphere orbits your head.

Intellect&lt;b&gt; (Very Rare).&lt;/b&gt; Your Intelligence score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this marbled scarlet and blue sphere orbits your head.

Leadership &lt;b&gt;(Very Rare).&lt;/b&gt; Your Charisma score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this marbled pink and green sphere orbits your head.

Mastery &lt;b&gt;(Legendary).&lt;/b&gt; Your proficiency bonus increases by 1 while this pale green prism orbits your head.

Protection &lt;b&gt;(Rare).&lt;/b&gt; You gain a +1 bonus to AC while this dusty rose prism orbits your head.

Regeneration&lt;b&gt; (Legendary).&lt;/b&gt; You regain 15 hit points at the end of each hour this pearly white spindle orbits your head, provided that you have at least 1 hit point.

Reserve&lt;b&gt; (Rare).&lt;/b&gt; This vibrant purple prism stores spells cast into it, holding them until you use them. The stone can store up to 3 levels worth of spells at a time. When found, it contains 1d4-1 levels of stored spells chosen by the GM.

Any creature can cast a spell of 1st through 3rd level into the stone by touching it as the spell is cast. The spell has no effect, other than to be stored in the stone. If the stone can't hold the spell, the spell is expended without effect. The level of the slot used to cast the spell determines how much space it uses.

While this stone orbits your head, you can cast any spell stored in it. The spell uses the slot level, spell save DC, spell attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the original caster, but is otherwise treated as if you cast the spell. The spell cast from the stone is no longer stored in it, freeing up space.

Strength&lt;b&gt; (Very Rare).&lt;/b&gt; Your Strength score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this pale blue rhomboid orbits your head.

Sustenance&lt;b&gt; (Rare).&lt;/b&gt; You don't need to eat or drink while this clear spindle orbits your head.

This other set of Ioun Stones come from the Extra Life Adventure: &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="/module/llok/page/llok"&gt;Lost Laboratory of Kwalish&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;.

Supreme Intellect&lt;b&gt; (Rare).&lt;/b&gt; You gain a +1 bonus to Intelligence checks while this faceted sphere orbits your head.

Historical Knowledge&lt;b&gt; (Rare).&lt;/b&gt; You gain proficiency in the History skill, or a +1 bonus to checks with that skill if already proficient, while this polished, steely sphere orbits your head.

Natural Knowledge&lt;b&gt; (Rare).&lt;/b&gt; You gain proficiency in the Nature skill, or a +1 bonus to checks with that skill if already proficient, while this burnished, brassy stone orbits your head.

Religious Knowledge&lt;b&gt; (Rare).&lt;/b&gt; You gain proficiency in the Religion skill, or a +1 bonus to checks with that skill if already proficient, while this tiny golden gem orbits your head.

Language Knowledge &lt;b&gt;(Rare).&lt;/b&gt; You are fluent in one additional language while this pulsating bit of red jeweled crystal orbits your head. The DM chooses the language bestowed by the stone.

Self-Preservation&lt;b&gt; (Rare).&lt;/b&gt; You gain a +1 bonus to Intelligence saving throws while this silvery gem orbits your head.

		<text>This tome contains information and incantations necessary to make a particular type of golem. To decipher and use the manual, you must be a spellcaster with at least two 5th-level spell slots. A creature that can't use a &lt;i&gt;manual of golems&lt;/i&gt; and attempts to read it takes 6d6 psychic damage.

D20     GOLEM             TIME       COST
1-5     Manual of Clay    30 days    65,000 GP
        Golems
6-17    Manual of Flesh   60 days    50,000 GP
        Golems
18      Manual of Iron    120 days   100,000 GP
        Golems
19-20   Manual of Stone   90 days    80,000 GP
        Golems

To create a golem, you must spend the time shown on the table, working without interruption with the manual at hand and resting no more than 8 hours per day. You must also pay the specified cost to purchase supplies.

Once you finish creating the golem, the book is consumed in eldritch flames. The golem becomes animate when the ashes of the manual are sprinkled on it. It is under your control, and it understands and obeys your spoken commands.

		<text>A spell scroll bears the words of a single spell, written in a mystical cipher. If the spell is on your class’s spell list, you can read the scroll and cast its spell without providing any material components. Otherwise, the scroll is unintelligible. Casting the spell by reading the scroll requires the spell’s normal casting time. Once the spell is cast, the words on the scroll fade, and it crumbles to dust. If the casting is interrupted, the scroll is not lost.

If the spell is on your class’s spell list but of a higher level than you can normally cast, you must make an ability check using your spellcasting ability to determine whether you cast it successfully. The DC equals 10 + the spell’s level. On a failed check, the spell disappears from the scroll with no other effect.

The level of the spell on the scroll determines the spell’s saving throw DC and attack bonus, as well as the scroll’s rarity, as shown in the Spell Scroll table.

A wizard spell on a &lt;i&gt;spell scroll&lt;/i&gt; can be copied just as spells in spellbooks can be copied. When a spell is copied from a &lt;i&gt;spell scroll&lt;/i&gt;, the copier must succeed on an Intelligence (Arcana) check with a DC equal to 10 + the spell's level. If the check succeeds, the spell is successfully copied. Whether the check succeeds or fails, the &lt;i&gt;spell scroll&lt;/i&gt; is destroyed.

----------------------------------------

&lt;b&gt;VARIANT: SCROLL MISHAPS&lt;/b&gt;

A creature who tries and fails to cast a spell from a &lt;i&gt;spell scroll&lt;/i&gt; must make a DC 10 Intelligence saving throw. If the saving throw fails, roll on the Scroll Mishap table.

SCROLL MISHAP

D6   RESULT
1    A surge of magical
     energy deals the
     caster 1d6 force
     damage per level of
     the spell.
2    The spell affects
     the caster or an
     ally (determined
     randomly) instead of
     the intended target,
     or it affects a
     random target nearby
     if the caster was
     the intended target.
3    The spell affects a
     random location
     within the spell’s
     range.
4    The spell’s effect
     is contrary to its
     normal one, but
     neither harmful nor
     beneficial. For
     instance, a fireball
     might produce an
     area of harmless
     cold.
5    The caster suffers a
     minor but bizarre
     effect related to
     the spell. Such
     effects last only as
     long as the original
     spell’s duration, or
     1d10 minutes for
     spells that take
     effect
     instantaneously. For
     example, a fireball
     might cause smoke to
     billow from the
     caster’s ears for
     1d10 minutes.
6    The spell activates
     after 1d12 hours. If
     the caster was the
     intended target, the
     spell takes effect
     normally. If the
     caster was not the
     intended target, the
     spell goes off in
     the general
     direction of the
     intended target, up
     to the spell’s
     maximum range, if
     the target has moved
     away.

		<text>Every shield guardian has an amulet magically linked to it. A shield guardian can have only one corresponding amulet, and if that amulet is destroyed, the shield guardian is incapacitated until a replacement amulet is created.

A shield guardian’s amulet is subject to direct attack if it isn’t being worn or carried. It has AC 10, 10 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. Crafting an amulet requires 1 week and costs 1,000 gp in components.

A shield guardian’s solitary focus is to protect the amulet’s wearer. The amulet’s wearer can command the guardian to attack its enemies or to guard the wielder against attack. If an attack threatens to injure the wearer, the construct can magically absorb the blow into its own body, even at a distance.

You can use an action to pull the fuzzy object from the bag and throw it up to 20 feet. When the object lands, it transforms into a creature you determine by rolling a d8 and consulting the table that corresponds to the bag's color. See the &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters"&gt;Monsters Listing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; for the creature's statistics. The creature vanishes at the next dawn or when it is reduced to 0 hit points.

The creature is friendly to you and your companions, and it acts on your turn. You can use a bonus action to command how the creature moves and what action it takes on its next turn, or to give it general orders, such as to attack your enemies. In the absence of such orders, the creature acts in a fashion appropriate to its nature.

Once three fuzzy objects have been pulled from the bag, the bag can't be used again until the next dawn.

&lt;b&gt;Gray Bag of Tricks&lt;/b&gt;

Whenever a hostile creature damages you while the axe is in your possession, you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or go berserk. While berserk, you must use your action each round to attack the creature nearest to you with the axe. If you can make extra attacks as part of the Attack action, you use those extra attacks, moving to attack the next nearest creature after you fell your current target. If you have multiple possible targets, you attack one at random. You are berserk until you start your turn with no creatures within 60 feet of you that you can see or hear.

In addition, you can speak the sword's command word to cause the blade to shed bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. Speaking the command word again or sheathing the sword puts out the light.

		<text>You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

The sword has 1d8 + 1 charges. If you score a critical hit against a creature that has fewer than 100 hit points, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be slain instantly as the sword tears its life force from its body (a construct or an undead is immune). The sword loses 1 charge if the creature is slain. When the sword has no charges remaining, it loses this property.

When you attack a creature that has at least one head with this weapon and roll a 20 on the attack roll, you cut off one of the creature's heads. The creature dies if it can't survive without the lost head. A creature is immune to this effect if it is immune to slashing damage, doesn't have or need a head, has legendary actions, or the GM decides that the creature is too big for its head to be cut off with this weapon. Such a creature instead takes an extra 6d8 slashing damage from the hit.

&lt;b&gt;Ivory Goats.&lt;/b&gt; These ivory statuettes of goats are always created in sets of three. Each goat looks unique and functions differently from the others. Their properties are as follows:

 * The &lt;i&gt;goat of traveling&lt;/i&gt; can become a Large goat with the same statistics as a riding horse. It has 24 charges, and each hour or portion thereof it spends in beast form costs 1 charge. While it has charges, you can use it as often as you wish. When it runs out of charges, it reverts to a figurine and can't be used again until 7 days have passed, when it regains all its charges.
 * The &lt;i&gt;goat of travail&lt;/i&gt; becomes a giant goat for up to 3 hours. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 30 days have passed.
 * The &lt;i&gt;goat of terror&lt;/i&gt; becomes a giant goat for up to 3 hours. The goat can't attack, but you can remove its horns and use them as weapons. One horn becomes a &lt;b&gt;lance, +1&lt;/b&gt;, and the other becomes a &lt;b&gt;longsword, +2&lt;/b&gt;. Removing a horn requires an action, and the weapons disappear and the horns return when the goat reverts to figurine form. In addition, the goat radiates a 30-foot-radius aura of terror while you are riding it. Any creature hostile to you that starts its turn in the aura must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of the goat for 1 minute, or until the goat reverts to figurine form. The frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once it successfully saves against the effect, a creature is immune to the goat's aura for the next 24 hours. Once the figurine has been used, it can't be used again until 15 days have passed.

If you mount the nightmare while it is ignoring your orders, you and the nightmare are instantly transported to a random location on the plane of Hades, where the nightmare reverts to figurine form.

If you blow the horn without having proficiency with all martial weapons, the summoned berserkers attack you. If you meet the requirement, they are friendly to you and your companions and follow your commands.

When you use an action to toss one of these stones into the air, the stone orbits your head at a distance of 1d3 feet and confers a benefit to you. Thereafter, another creature must use an action to grasp or net the stone to separate it from you, either by making a successful attack roll against AC 24 or a successful DC 24 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. You can use an action to seize and stow the stone, ending its effect.

A stone has AC 24, 10 hit points, and resistance to all damage. It is considered to be an object that is being worn while it orbits your head.

&lt;b&gt;Absorption.&lt;/b&gt; While this pale lavender ellipsoid orbits your head, you can use your reaction to cancel a spell of 4th level or lower cast by a creature you can see and targeting only you.

Once the stone has canceled 20 levels of spells, it burns out and turns dull gray, losing its magic. If you are targeted by a spell whose level is higher than the number of spell levels the stone has left, the stone can't cancel it.

&lt;b&gt;Reserve.&lt;/b&gt; This vibrant purple prism stores spells cast into it, holding them until you use them. The stone can store up to 3 levels worth of spells at a time. When found, it contains 1d4-1 levels of stored spells chosen by the GM.

Any creature can cast a spell of 1st through 3rd level into the stone by touching it as the spell is cast. The spell has no effect, other than to be stored in the stone. If the stone can't hold the spell, the spell is expended without effect. The level of the slot used to cast the spell determines how much space it uses.

While this stone orbits your head, you can cast any spell stored in it. The spell uses the slot level, spell save DC, spell attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the original caster, but is otherwise treated as if you cast the spell. The spell cast from the stone is no longer stored in it, freeing up space.

If you are a bard, you can scribe an additional seven words and choose to make the message glow faintly, allowing it to be seen in nonmagical darkness. Casting dispel magic on the message erases it. Otherwise, the message fades away after 24 hours.

The instrument regains all expended charges daily at dawn.

		<text>Produced by a special needle, this magic tattoo features designs that emphasize one color.

&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tattoo Attunement.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; To attune to this item, you hold the needle to your skin where you want the tattoo to appear, pressing the needle there throughout the attunement process. When the attunement is complete, the needle turns into the ink that becomes the tattoo, which appears on the skin. If your attunement to the tattoo ends, the tattoo vanishes, and the needle reappears in your space.

&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Damage Resistance.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; While the tattoo is on your skin, you have resistance to a type of damage associated with that color, as shown on the table below. The DM chooses the color or determines it randomly.

D10   DAMAGE TYPE   COLOR
1     Acid          Green
2     Cold          Blue
3     Fire          Red
4     Force         White

7     Poison        Violet
8     Psychic       Silver
9     Radiant       Gold
10    Thunder       Orange

&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Damage Absorption.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; When you take damage of the chosen type, you can use your reaction to gain immunity against that instance of the damage, and you regain a number of hit points equal to half the damage you would have taken. Once this reaction is used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.

While you are holding the book, you can use it as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.

The book has 3 charges, and it regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. You can use the charges in the following ways while holding it:

 * If you spend 1 minute studying the book, you can expend 1 charge to replace one of your prepared wizard spells with a different spell in the book. The new spell must be of the transmutation school.
 * As an action, you can touch a nonmagical object that isn’t being worn or carried and spend a number of charges to transform the target into another object. For 1 charge, the object can be no larger than 1 foot on a side. You can spend additional charges to increase the maximum dimensions by 2 feet per charge. The new object must have a gold value equal to or less than the original.

While holding this tool, you gain a bonus to the spell attack rolls and the saving throw DCs of your artificer spells. The bonus is determined by the tool’s rarity.

As an action, you can focus on the tool to channel your creative forces. Choose a cantrip that you don't know from any class list. For 8 hours, you can cast that cantrip, and it counts as an artificer cantrip for you. Once this property is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

		<text>The creations of the immortal hag Baba Yaga defy the laws of mortal magic. Among the notorious implements that cement her legend on countless worlds are the artifacts that propel her through the planes: &lt;i&gt;Baba Yaga's Mortar and Pestle&lt;/i&gt;. These signature tools of Baba Yaga are a single artifact for purposes of attunement. Should the two objects become separated, the pestle appears next to the mortar at the next dawn.

&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Random Properties.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; This artifact has the following random properties, which you can determine by rolling on the tables in the "&lt;a href="/module/dmg/page/sentient-magic-items-artifacts#Artifacts"&gt;Artifacts&lt;/a&gt;" section of the &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="/module/dmg/page/dmg"&gt;Dungeon Master's Guide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;:

 * 2 minor beneficial properties
 * 1 major beneficial property
 * 1 minor detrimental property

&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Properties of the Mortar.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; The mortar is a Tiny wooden bowl. However, the mortar increases in size to accommodate anything you place inside, expanding-if there's enough space-up to Large size, meaning it can hold even a Large creature.

&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Properties of the Pestle.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; The pestle is a 6-inch-long, worn wooden tool. Once during your turn while you are holding the pestle, you can extend it into a quarterstaff or shrink it back into a pestle (no action required). As a quarterstaff, the pestle is a magic weapon that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.

The pestle has 12 charges. When you hit with a melee attack using the pestle, you can expend up to 3 of its charges to deal an extra 1d8 force damage for each charge expended. The pestle regains all expended charges daily at dawn.

&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Perfect Tools.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; While holding the mortar and pestle, you can use your action to say the name of any nonmagical plant, mineral, or fluid and an amount of the material worth 10 gp or less. The mortar instantly fills with the desired amount of that material. Once you use this action, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

You can also use the artifact as alchemist's supplies, brewer's supplies, cook's utensils, an herbalism kit, and a poisoner's kit. You have advantage on any check you make using the artifact as one of these tools.

&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Primal Parts.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; As an action while the pestle and the mortar is within 5 feet of you, you can command the pestle to grind. For the next minute, or until you use your action to verbally command it to stop, the pestle moves on its own, grinding the contents of the mortar into a mush or fine powder that's equally useful for cooking or alchemy. At the start of each of your turns, whatever is in the mortar takes 4d10 force damage. If this reduces the target's hit points to 0, the target is reduced to powder, pulp, or paste, as appropriate. Only magic items are unaffected. If you wish, when the pestle stops, you can have the mortar separate its contents-like powdered bone, crushed herbs, pulped organs-into separate piles.

&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Traverse the Night.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; If you are holding the pestle while you are inside the mortar, you can use your action to verbally command the mortar to travel to a specific place or creature. You don't need to know where your destination is, but it must be a specific destination-not just the nearest river or a red dragon's lair. If the stated destination is within 1,000 miles of you, the mortar lifts into the air and vanishes. You and any creatures in the mortar travel through a dreamlike sky, with hazy reflections of the world passing by below. Creatures might see images of you streaking through the sky between your point of origin and the destination. You arrive at the location 1 hour later or, if it is night, 1 minute later.

&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bones Know Their Home.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; When you command the mortar to travel, you can instead throw out the dust or paste of something ground by the mortar and name a location on a different plane of existence or a different world on the Material Plane. If that material came from a creature native to the named plane or world, the mortar travels through an empty night sky to an unoccupied space at that destination, arriving in 1 minute.

&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Destroying the Mortar and Pestle.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; The mortar and pestle are destroyed if they are crushed underfoot by the &lt;i&gt;Dancing Hut of Baba Yaga&lt;/i&gt; or by Baba Yaga herself.

		<text>This silver implement is shaped like a tree branch and is strung with small golden bells. The branch is a spellcasting focus for your spells while you hold it.

The branch has 3 charges, and it regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. You can use the charges in the following ways while holding it:

 * As a bonus action, you can expend 1 charge to detect the presence of aberrations, celestials, constructs, elementals, fey, fiends, or undead within 60 feet of you. If such creatures are present and don’t have total cover from you, the bells ring softly, their tone indicating the creature types present.
 * As an action, you can expend 1 charge to cast protection from evil and good.

When the attunement is complete, the needle turns into the ink that becomes the tattoo, which appears on the skin.

If your attunement to the tattoo ends, the tattoo vanishes, and the needle reappears in your space.

&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bloodthirsty Strikes.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; The tattoo has 10 charges, and it regains all expended charges daily at dawn. While this tattoo is on your skin, you gain the following benefits:

 * When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend a charge to deal an extra 4d6 necrotic damage to the target, and you regain a number of hit points equal to the necrotic damage dealt.
 * When a creature you can see damages you, you can expend a charge and use your reaction to make a melee attack against that creature, with advantage on your attack roll.

		<text>This Tiny pot bears relief scenes of heroes on its cast iron sides. You can use the cauldron as a spellcasting focus for your spells, and it functions as a suitable component for the scrying spell. When you finish a long rest, you can use the cauldron to create a potion of greater healing. The potion lasts for 24 hours, then loses its magic if not consumed.

As an action, you can cause the cauldron to grow large enough for a Medium creature to crouch within. You can revert the cauldron to its normal size as an action, harmlessly shunting anything that can’t fit inside to the nearest unoccupied space.

If you place the corpse of a humanoid into the cauldron and cover the corpse with 200 pounds of salt (which costs 10 gp) for at least 8 hours, the salt is consumed and the creature returns to life as if by raise dead at the next dawn. Once used, this property can’t be used again for 7 days.

		<type>W</type>
		<text>Ages ago, the serene god Rao created a tool to shield his fledgling faithful against the evils of the Lower Planes. Yet, as eons passed, mortals developed their own methods of dealing with existential threats, and the crook was largely forgotten. In recent ages, though, the &lt;i&gt;Crook of Rao&lt;/i&gt; was rediscovered and leveraged against the rising power of the Witch Queen Iggwilv (one of the names of the wizard Tasha). Although she was defeated, Iggwilv managed to damage the crook during the battle, infecting it with an insidious curse-and the potential for future victory. In the aftermath, the crook was again lost. Occasionally it reappears, but the famed artifact is not what it was. Whether or not the artifact’s bearers realize its full threat, few risk using the &lt;i&gt;Crook of Rao&lt;/i&gt;-potentially for the final time.

&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Random Properties.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; The artifact has the following random properties, which you can determine by rolling on the tables in the "&lt;a href="/module/dmg/page/sentient-magic-items-artifacts#Artifacts"&gt;Artifacts&lt;/a&gt;" section of the &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="/module/dmg/page/dmg"&gt;Dungeon Master’s Guide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;:

 * 2 minor beneficial properties
 * 1 major beneficial property
 * 1 minor detrimental property

&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Spells.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; The crook has 6 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from it: aura of life (2 charges), aura of purity (2 charges), banishment (1 charge), beacon of hope (1 charge), mass cure wounds (3 charges). The crook regains 1d6 expended charges daily at dawn.

&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Absolute Banishment.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; While you are attuned to the crook and holding it, you can spend 10 minutes to banish all but the mightiest fiends within 1 mile of you. Any fiend with a challenge rating of 19 or higher is unaffected. Each banished fiend is sent back to its home plane and can’t return to the plane the &lt;i&gt;Crook of Rao&lt;/i&gt; banished it from for 100 years.

&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Failing Matrix.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Whenever the &lt;i&gt;Crook of Rao&lt;/i&gt;’s Absolute Banishment property is used, or when its last charge is expended, roll on the Extraplanar Reversal table. Any creatures conjured as a result of this effect appear in random unoccupied spaces within 60 feet of you and are not under your control.

EXTRAPLANAR REVERSAL

D100    EFFECT

        plane opens. The

86-90   1 balor and 1 pit
        fiend appear. At the
        DM’s discretion, a
        portal opens into
        the presence of an
        archdevil or demon
        lord instead, then
        closes after 5
        minutes.
91-00   Iggwilv’s Curse (see
        the Iggwilv’s Curse
        property).

&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Iggwilv’s Curse.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; When the Crook was last used against Iggwilv, the Witch Queen lashed out at the artifact, infecting its magical matrix. Over the years, this curse has spread within the crook, threatening to violently pervert its ancient magic. If this occurs, the &lt;i&gt;Crook of Rao&lt;/i&gt;, as it is currently known, is destroyed, its magical matrix inverting and exploding into a 50-foot-diameter portal. This portal functions as a permanent gate spell cast by Iggwilv. The gate then, once per round on initiative count 20, audibly speaks a fiend’s name in Iggwilv’s voice, doing so until the gate calls on every fiend ever banished by the &lt;i&gt;Crook of Rao&lt;/i&gt;. If the fiend still exists, it is drawn through the gate. This process takes eighteen years to complete, at the end of which the gate becomes a permanent portal to Pazunia, the first layer of the Abyss.

&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Destroying or Repairing the Crook.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; The &lt;i&gt;Crook of Rao&lt;/i&gt; can either be destroyed or repaired by journeying to Mount Celestia and obtaining a tear from the eternally serene god Rao. One way to make the emotionless god cry would be to reunite Rao with the spirit of his first worshiper who sought revelations beyond the multiverse long ago. The Crook dissolves if immersed in the god’s tear for a year and a day. If washed in the tear daily for 30 days, the Crook loses its Failing Matrix property.

		<text>Not all lingering spirits are tragic souls, lost on their way to the hereafter. Some languish as prisoners, souls so wicked mortals dare not free them upon an unsuspecting afterlife.

Created by a figure of Vistani legend, &lt;i&gt;Luba’s Tarokka of Souls&lt;/i&gt; shaped the destiny of countless heroes. The prophecies of this deck of cards also revealed great evils and guided its creator into the path of nefarious forces. Untold times the deck’s creator, Mother Luba, narrowly escaped doom, spared only by her keen insights. But even for her, not all wickedness could be escaped. In the most dire cases, Mother Luba managed to ensnare beings of pure evil amid the strands of fate, imprisoning them within her tarokka deck. There these foul spirits dwell still, trapped within a nether-realm hidden amid shuffling cards, waiting for fate to turn foul-as it inevitably will.

Like all tarokka decks, the &lt;i&gt;Tarokka of Souls&lt;/i&gt; is a lavishly illustrated collection of fifty-four cards, comprising the fourteen cards of the high deck and forty other cards divided into four suits: coins, glyphs, stars, and swords.

&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Random Properties.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; The artifact has the following random properties, which you can determine by rolling on the tables in the “&lt;a href="/module/dmg/page/sentient-magic-items-artifacts#ArtifactProperties"&gt;Artifacts&lt;/a&gt;” section of the &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="/module/dmg/page/dmg"&gt;Dungeon Master’s Guide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;:

 * 2 minor detrimental properties
 * 2 minor beneficial properties

&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Spells.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; While holding the deck, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from it: comprehend languages, detect evil and good, detect magic, detect poison and disease, locate object, or scrying. Once you use the deck to cast a spell, you can’t cast that spell again from it until the next dawn.

&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Enduring Vision.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; While holding the deck, you automatically succeed on Constitution saving throws made to maintain your concentration on divination spells.

&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Twist of Fate.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; As an action, you can draw a card from the deck and twist the fortune of another creature you can see within 15 feet of you. Choose one of the following effects:

&lt;b&gt;Weal.&lt;/b&gt; The creature has advantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws for the next hour.

&lt;b&gt;Woe.&lt;/b&gt; The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws for the next hour.

The deck can be used in this way twice, and you regain all expended uses at the next dawn.

&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Prisoners of Fate.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Whenever you use the Twist of Fate property, there is a chance that one of the souls trapped in the deck escapes. Roll d100 and consult the Souls of the Tarokka table. If you roll one of the high cards, the soul associated with it escapes. You can find its statistics in the &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="/module/mm/page/mm"&gt;Monster Manual&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;. If you roll a soul that has already escaped, roll again.

&lt;b&gt;15-00&lt;/b&gt;   -             -

The released soul appears at a random location within 10d10 miles of you and terrorizes the living. Until the released soul is destroyed, it gains the benefit of a weal from the deck’s Twist of Fate property, and both you and the original target of Twist of Fate suffer the effect of woe.

&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Shuffling Fate.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; If you go 7 days without using the Twist of Fate property, your attunement to &lt;i&gt;Luba’s Tarroka of Souls&lt;/i&gt; ends, and you can’t attune to it again until after another creature uses Twist of Fate on you.

&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Destroying the Deck.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Luba’s Tarokka of Souls&lt;/i&gt; can be destroyed only if all fourteen souls within are released and destroyed. This reveals a fifteenth soul, a lich, that inhabits the Nether card, which appears only when the fourteen souls are defeated. If this ancient entity is destroyed, the Nether card vanishes and the deck becomes a normal tarokka deck, with no special properties, but it includes a new card of the DM’s design.

&lt;b&gt;Mother Luba and the Vistani&lt;/b&gt;

The creator of the &lt;i&gt;Tarokka of Souls&lt;/i&gt;, Mother Luba was one of the most influential leaders of the Vistani. For untold generations, the Vistani have wandered the Shadowfell, which includes terrifying demiplanes like the vampire-haunted realm of Barovia. These travelers have learned many secrets of these domains and encountered countless others wandering amid the Shadowfell’s horrors. Most Vistani bands accept well-intentioned wayfarers from diverse walks and of disparate origins, embracing any who seek to find a home amid the endless roads and vistas hidden amid the mists.

A halfling Vistani, Mother Luba led one of the largest groups of Vistani in the Shadowfell. She hailed from the same world that Count Strahd von Zarovich and Madam Eva came from, and she created a community of kindness and resilience-ever rare to find in the Plane of Shadow. She led her people in welcoming strangers, feeding the hungry, and defying the cruel. She and Madam Eva were once friends, until Madam Eva began bargaining with the creatures of the night. “We may wander amid the shadows,” Mother Luba said. “But we must ever serve as a light to our fellow travelers.”

Some years ago, Mother Luba disappeared into the mists, leaving behind only the &lt;i&gt;Tarokka of Souls&lt;/i&gt;. It is said that if you draw the Mists card from it, you can hear the whispers of her kind voice.

		<value/>

		<rarity>Artifact</rarity>
		<attunement>requires attunement</attunement>
		<type>W</type>
		<text>Named for the warlord who infamously employed it, the Mighty Servant of Leuk-o is a fantastically powerful, 10-foot-tall machine that turns into an animate construct when piloted. Crafted of a gleaming black alloy of unknown origin, the servant is often described as a combination of a disproportioned dwarf and an oversized beetle. The servant contains enough space for 1 ton of cargo and a crew compartment within, from which up to two Medium creatures can control it-and potentially execute a spree of unstoppable destruction.

Tales of the servant’s origins involve more conjecture than fact, often referring to otherworldly beings, the mysterious Barrier Peaks in Oerth, and the supposedly related device known as the &lt;i&gt;Machine of Lum the Mad&lt;/i&gt;. The best details on the device’s origins and operation can be found in the &lt;i&gt;Mind of Metal&lt;/i&gt;, a tome of artificer’s secrets that connects the device to the traditions of the lost Olman people, and which was written by Lum the Mad’s several times over granddaughter, Lum the Maestro, while she reconstructed the long disassembled Mighty Servant of Leuk-o.

&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dangerous Attunement.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Two creatures can be attuned to the servant at a time. If a third creature tries to attune to it, nothing happens.

The servant’s controls are accessed by a hatch in its upper back, which is easily opened while there are no creatures attuned to the artifact.

Attuning to the artifact requires two hours, which can be undertaken as part of a long rest, during which time you must be inside the servant, interacting with its controls. While crew members are attuning themselves, any creature or structure outside and within 50 feet of the servant has a 25 percent chance of being accidentally targeted by one of its Destructive Fist attacks once during the attunement. This process must be undergone every time a creature attunes itself to the artifact.

&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Controlling the Servant.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; While any creatures are attuned to the artifact, attuned creatures can open the hatch as easily as any other door. Other creatures can open the hatch as an action with a successful DC 25 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools. A knock spell cast on the hatch also opens it until the start of the caster’s next turn.

A creature can enter or exit through the hatch by spending 10 feet of movement. Those inside the servant have total cover from effects originating outside it. The controls within it allow creatures to see outside without obstruction.

While you are inside the servant, you can command it by using the controls. During your turn (for either attuned creature), you can command it in the following ways:

 * Open or close the hatch (no action required, once per turn)
 * Move the servant up to its speed (no action required)
 * As an action, you can command the servant to take one of the actions in its stat block or some other action.
 * When a creature provokes an opportunity attack from the servant, you can use your reaction to command the servant to make one Destructive Fist attack against that creature.

While there are no attuned creatures inside the servant, it is an inert object.

&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ghost in the Machine.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Upon his death, the soul of the mighty warlord Leuk-o was drawn into the artifact and has become its animating force. The servant has been known to attack or move of its own accord, particularly if doing so will cause destruction. Once every 24 hours, the servant, at the DM’s discretion, takes one action while uncrewed.

If the servant loses half of its hit points or more, each creature attuned to it must succeed on a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed for 24 hours. While charmed in this way, the creature goes on a destructive spree, seeking to destroy structures and attack any unattuned creatures within sight of the servant, starting with those threatening the artifact- preferably using the servant, if possible.

&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Self-Destruct.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/i&gt;By inputting a specific series of lever pulls and button presses, the servant’s two crew members can cause it to explode. The self-destruct code is not revealed to crew members when they attune to the artifact. If the code is discovered (the DM determines how), it requires two attuned crew members to be inside the servant and spend their actions on 3 consecutive rounds performing the command. Should the crew members begin the process of entering the code, though, the servant uses its Ghost in the Machine property and turns the crew members against each other.

If the crew members successfully implement the code, at the end of the third round, the servant explodes. Every creature in a 100-foot-radius sphere centered on the servant must make a DC 25 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 87 (25d6) force damage, 87 (25d6) lightning damage, and 87 (25d6) thunder damage. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage. Objects and structures in the area take triple damage. Creatures inside the servant are slain instantly and leave behind no remains.

This does not destroy the servant permanently. Rather, 2d6 days later, its parts-left arm, left leg, right arm, right leg, lower torso, and upper torso- drop from the sky in random places within 1,000 miles of the explosion. If brought within 5 feet of one another, the pieces reconnect and reform the servant.

&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Destroying the Servant.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; The servant can be destroyed in two ways. After it has self-destructed, its disconnected pieces can be melted down in one of the forge-temples of its ancient Olman creators. Alternatively, if the servant strikes the &lt;i&gt;Machine of Lum the Mad&lt;/i&gt;, both artifacts explode in an eruption that is three times the size and three times the damage as the servant’s self-destruct property.

		<text>An expansive treatise documenting the Abyss’s infinite layers and inhabitants, the &lt;i&gt;Demonomicon of Iggwilv&lt;/i&gt; is the most thorough and blasphemous tome of demonology in the multiverse. The tome recounts both the oldest and most current profanities of the Abyss and demons. Demons have attempted to censor the text, and while sections have been ripped from the book’s spine, the general chapters remain, ever revealing demonic secrets. And the book holds more than blasphemies. Caged behind lines of script roils a secret piece of the Abyss itself, which keeps the book up-to-date, no matter how many pages are removed, and it longs to be more than mere reference material.

&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Random Properties.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; The artifact has the following random properties, which you can determine by rolling on the tables in the “&lt;a href="/module/dmg/page/sentient-magic-items-artifacts#Artifacts"&gt;Artifacts&lt;/a&gt;” section of the &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="/module/dmg/page/dmg"&gt;Dungeon Master’s Guide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;:

 * 2 minor beneficial properties
 * 1 minor detrimental property
 * 1 major detrimental property

&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Spells.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; The book has 8 charges. It regains 1d8 expended charges daily at dawn. While holding it, you can use an action to cast Tasha’s hideous laughter from it or to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 20) from it: magic circle (1 charge), magic jar (3 charges), planar ally (3 charges), planar binding (2 charges), plane shift (to layers of the Abyss only; 3 charges), summon fiend (3 charges).

&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abyssal Reference.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; You can reference the &lt;i&gt;Demonomicon&lt;/i&gt; whenever you make an Intelligence check to discern information about demons or a Wisdom (Survival) check related to the Abyss. When you do so, you can add double your proficiency bonus to the check.

&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fiendish Scourging.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Your magic causes pain to fiends. While carrying the book, when you make a damage roll for a spell you cast against a fiend, you use the maximum possible result instead of rolling.

&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ensnarement.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; While carrying the book, whenever you cast the magic circle spell naming only fiends, or the planar binding spell targeting a fiend, the spell is cast at 9th level, regardless of what level spell slot you used, if any. Additionally, the fiend has disadvantage on its saving throw against the spell.

&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Containment.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; The first 10 pages of the &lt;i&gt;Demonomicon&lt;/i&gt; are blank. As an action while holding the book, you can target a fiend that you can see that is trapped within a magic circle. The fiend must succeed on a DC 20 Charisma saving throw with disadvantage or become trapped within one of the &lt;i&gt;Demonomicon’s&lt;/i&gt; empty blank pages, which fills with writing detailing the trapped creature’s widely known name and depravities. Once used, this action can’t be used again until the next dawn.

When you finish a long rest, if you and the &lt;i&gt;Demonomicon&lt;/i&gt; are on the same plane of existence, the trapped creature of the highest challenge rating within the book can attempt to possess you. You must make a DC 20 Charisma saving throw. On a failure, you are possessed by the creature, which controls you like a puppet. The possessing creature can release you as an action, appearing in the closest unoccupied space. On a successful save, the fiend can’t try to possess you again for 7 days.

When the tome is discovered, it has 1d4 fiends occupying its pages, typically an assortment of demons.

&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Destroying the Demonomicon.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; To destroy the book, six different demon lords must each tear out a sixth of the book’s pages. If this occurs, the pages reappear after 24 hours. Before all those hours pass, anyone who opens the book’s remaining binding is transported to a nascent layer of the Abyss that lies hidden within the book. At the heart of this deadly, semi-sentient domain lies a long-lost artifact, &lt;i&gt;Fraz-Urb’luu’s Staff&lt;/i&gt;. If the staff is dragged from the pocket plane, the tome is reduced to a mundane and quite out-of-date copy of the &lt;i&gt;Tome of Zyx&lt;/i&gt;, the work that served as the foundation for the &lt;i&gt;Demonomicon&lt;/i&gt;. Once the staff emerges, the demon lord Fraz-Urb’luu instantly knows.

As an action, you can attach the shard to a Tiny object (such as a weapon or a piece of jewelry) or detach it. It falls off if your attunement to it ends. You can use the shard as a spellcasting focus while you hold or wear it.

When you use a Metamagic option on a spell while you are holding or wearing the shard, you can momentarily curse one creature targeted by the spell; choose one ability score, and until the end of your next turn, the creature has disadvantage on ability checks and saving throws that use that ability.

		<text>Produced by a special needle, this magic tattoo contains a single spell of up to 5th level, wrought on your skin by a magic needle. To use the tattoo, you must hold the needle against your skin and speak the command word. The needle turns into ink that becomes the tattoo, which appears on the skin in whatever design you like. Once the tattoo is there, you can cast its spell, requiring no material components. The tattoo glows faintly while you cast the spell and for the spell’s duration. Once the spell ends, the tattoo vanishes from your skin.

The level of the spell in the tattoo determines the spell’s saving throw DC, attack bonus, spellcasting ability modifier, and the tattoo’s rarity, as shown in the Spellwrought Tattoo table.

		<text>The Teeth of Dahlver-Nar are stories given form. They are a collection of teeth, each suggestive of wildly different origins and made from various materials. The collection rests within a leather pouch, stitched with images of heroes and whimsical creatures. Where the teeth fall, they bring legends to life.

&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Using the Teeth.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; While you are holding the pouch, you can use an action to draw one tooth. Roll on the Teeth of Dahlver-Nar table to determine which tooth you draw, and you can either sow the tooth or implant it (both of which are described later).

If you don’t sow or implant the tooth, roll a die at the end of your turn. On an even number, the tooth vanishes, and creatures appear as if you sowed the tooth, but they are hostile to you and your allies. On an odd number, the tooth replaces one of your teeth as if you implanted it (potentially replacing another implanted tooth, see below).

Each tooth can only be used once. Track which teeth have been used. If a tooth’s result is rolled after it’s been used, you draw the next lowest unused tooth on the table.

&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sowing Teeth.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; To sow the tooth, you place it on the ground in an unoccupied space within your reach, or you throw it into an unoccupied space within 10 feet of you in a body of water that is at least 50 feet wide and 50 feet long. Upon doing so, the tooth burrows into the ground and vanishes, leaving no hole behind, or it vanishes into the water. The creatures noted in the Creatures Summoned column appear in an unoccupied space as close to where the tooth was sown as possible. The creatures are allies to you, speak all languages you speak, and linger for 10 minutes before disappearing, unless otherwise noted.

&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Implanting Teeth.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; To implant the tooth, you place it in your mouth, whereupon one of your own teeth falls out, and the drawn tooth takes its place, resizing to fit in your mouth. Once the tooth is implanted, you gain the effect noted in the Implanted Effect column. The tooth can’t be removed while you are attuned to the teeth, and you can’t voluntarily end your attunement to them. If removed after your death, the tooth vanishes. You can have a maximum number of the teeth implanted at one time equal to 1 + your Constitution modifier (minimum of 2 teeth total). If you try to implant more teeth, the newly implanted tooth replaces one of the previous teeth, determined randomly. The replaced tooth vanishes, and you lose the implanted effect.

&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Recovering Teeth.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Once all the teeth have vanished, their pouch also vanishes. The pouch with all the teeth then appears in a random destination, which could be on a different world of the Material Plane.

&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Destroying the Teeth.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Each tooth must be destroyed individually by sowing it in the area where the tooth’s story originated, with the intention to destroy it. When planted in this way, creatures summoned are not friendly to you and do not vanish. Some of the creatures summoned merely head off in search of home, while others act as their tales dictate. In either case, the tooth is gone forever.

 * If you spend 1 minute studying the book, you can expend 1 charge to replace one of your prepared wizard spells with a different spell in the book. The new spell must be of the illusion school.
 * When a creature you can see makes an Intelligence (Investigation) check to discern the true nature of an illusion spell you cast, or makes a saving throw against an illusion spell you cast, you can use your reaction and expend 1 charge to impose disadvantage on the roll.

These signature tools of Baba Yaga are a single artifact for purposes of attunement. Should the two objects become separated, the pestle appears next to the mortar at the next dawn.

&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Random Properties.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/i&gt;This artifact has the following random properties, which you can determine by rolling on the tables in the “&lt;a href="/module/dmg/page/sentient-magic-items-artifacts#Artifacts"&gt;Artifacts&lt;/a&gt;” section of the &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="/module/dmg/page/dmg"&gt;Dungeon Master’s Guide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;:

 * 1 major beneficial property
 * 1 minor detrimental property

&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Properties of the Pestle.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; The pestle is a 6-inch-long, worn wooden tool. Once during your turn while you are holding the pestle, you can extend it into a quarterstaff or shrink it back into a pestle (no action required). As a quarterstaff, the pestle is a magic weapon that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.

The pestle has 12 charges. When you hit with a melee attack using the pestle, you can expend up to 3 of its charges to deal an extra 1d8 force damage for each charge expended. The pestle regains all expended charges daily at dawn.

&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Destroying the Mortar and Pestle.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; The mortar and pestle are destroyed if they are crushed underfoot by the &lt;i&gt;Dancing Hut of Baba Yaga&lt;/i&gt; or by Baba Yaga herself.

&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Properties of the Mortar.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; The mortar is a Tiny wooden bowl. However, the mortar increases in size to accommodate anything you place inside, expanding-if there's enough space-up to Large size, meaning it can hold even a Large creature.

&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Traverse the Night.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; If you are holding the pestle while you are inside the mortar, you can use your action to verbally command the mortar to travel to a specific place or creature. You don't need to know where your destination is, but it must be a specific destination-not just the nearest river or a red dragon's lair. If the stated destination is within 1,000 miles of you, the mortar lifts into the air and vanishes. You and any creatures in the mortar travel through a dreamlike sky, with hazy reflections of the world passing by below. Creatures might see images of you streaking through the sky between your point of origin and the destination. You arrive at the location 1 hour later or, if it is night, 1 minute later.

&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bones Know Their Home.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; When you command the mortar to travel, you can instead throw out the dust or paste of something ground by the mortar and name a location on a different plane of existence or a different world on the Material Plane. If that material came from a creature native to the named plane or world, the mortar travels through an empty night sky to an unoccupied space at that destination, arriving in 1 minute.

&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Destroying the Mortar and Pestle.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; The mortar and pestle are destroyed if they are crushed underfoot by the &lt;i&gt;Dancing Hut of Baba Yaga&lt;/i&gt; or by Baba Yaga herself.

		<text>This magic tattoo contains a single 5th Level Spell, wrought on your skin by a magic needle. To use the tattoo, you must hold the needle against your skin and speak the command word. The needle turns into ink that becomes the tattoo, which appears on the skin in whatever design you like. Once the tattoo is there, you can cast its spell, requiring no material components. The tattoo glows faintly while you cast the spell and for the spell’s duration. Once the spell ends, the tattoo vanishes from your skin.

The level of the spell in the tattoo determines the spell’s saving throw DC, attack bonus, spellcasting ability modifier, and the tattoo’s rarity, as shown in the Spellwrought Tattoo table.

The trap is affixed by a heavy chain to an immobile object, such as a tree or a spike driven into the ground. A creature that steps on the plate must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take 1d4 piercing damage and stop moving. Thereafter, until the creature breaks free of the trap, its movement is limited by the length of the chain (typically 3 feet long). A creature can use its action to make a DC 13 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Each failed check deals 1 piercing damage to the trapped creature.

		<text>Oil usually comes in a clay flask that holds 1 pint. As an action, you can splash the oil in this flask onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw it up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack against a target creature or object, treating the oil as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target is covered in oil. If the target takes any fire damage before the oil dries (after 1 minute), the target takes an additional 5 fire damage from the burning oil. You can also pour a flask of oil on the ground to cover a 5-foot-square area, provided that the surface is level. If lit, the oil burns for 2 rounds and deals 5 fire damage to any creature that enters the area or ends its turn in the area. A creature can take this damage only once per turn.

On each successive failed save, the character takes 3 (1d6) [rule]poison damage[/rule]. After three successful saves, the poison ends.

&lt;b&gt;Inhaled.&lt;/b&gt; These poisons are powders or gases that take effect when inhaled. Blowing the powder or releasing the gas subjects creatures in a 5-foot cube to its effect. The resulting cloud dissipates immediately afterward. Holding one's breath is ineffective against inhaled poisons, as they affect nasal membranes, tear ducts, and other parts of the body.

		<text>This poison is typically made only by the drow, and only in a place far removed from sunlight. A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 hour. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is also unconscious while poisoned in this way. The creature wakes up if it takes damage or if another creature takes an action to shake it awake.

&lt;b&gt;Injury.&lt;/b&gt; Injury poison can be applied to weapons, ammunition, trap components, and other objects that deal piercing or slashing damage and remains potent until delivered through a wound or washed off. A creature that takes piercing or slashing damage from an object coated with the poison is exposed to its effects.

One of the smallest sailing vessels, [vehicle]keelboat;keelboats[/vehicle] can be sailed or rowed by a single person. These ships often transport small amounts of cargo or passengers. They're perfect for pleasure cruises, as they're easier and less expensive to operate than larger vessels.

Keelboats and rowboats are used on lakes and rivers. If going downstream, add the speed of the current (typically 3 miles per hour) to the speed of the vehicle. These vehicles can’t be rowed against any significant current, but they can be pulled upstream by draft animals on the shores.

A character can bind sticks of dynamite together so they explode at the same time. Each additional stick increases the damage by 1d6 (to a maximum of 10d6) and the burst radius by 5 feet (to a maximum of 20 feet).

Dynamite can be rigged with a longer fuse to explode after a set amount of time, usually 1 to 6 rounds. Roll initiative for the dynamite. After the set number of rounds goes by, the dynamite explodes on that initiative.

A Large or smaller creature hit by a net is restrained until it is freed. A net has no effect on creatures that are formless, or creatures that are Huge or larger. A creature can use its action to make a DC 10 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC 10) also frees the creature without harming it, ending the effect and destroying the net.

When you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to attack with a net, you can make only one attack regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

		<text>Firearms are a new and volatile technology, and as such bring their own unique set of weapon properties. Some properties are followed by a number, and this number signifies an element of that property (outlined below). These properties replace the optional ones presented in the &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="/module/dmg/page/dmg"&gt;Dungeon Master’s Guide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;. Firearms are ranged weapons.

&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Reload.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; The weapon can be fired a number of times equal to its Reload score before you must spend 1 attack or 1 action to reload. You must have one free hand to reload a firearm.

&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Misfire.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Whenever you make an attack roll with a firearm, and the dice roll is equal to or lower than the weapon’s Misfire score, the weapon misfires. The attack misses, and the weapon cannot be used again until you spend an action to try and repair it. To repair your firearm, you must make a successful Tinker’s Tools check (DC equal to 8 + misfire score). If your check fails, the weapon is broken and must be mended out of combat at a quarter of the cost of the firearm. Creatures who use a firearm without being proficient increase the weapon’s misfire score by 1.

&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Explosive.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Upon a hit, everything within 5 ft of the target must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier) or suffer 1d8 fire damage. If the weapon misses, the ammunition fails to detonate, or bounces away harmlessly before doing so.

&lt;b&gt;Ammunition&lt;/b&gt;

All firearms require ammunition to make an attack, and due to their rare nature, ammunition may be near impossible to find or purchase. However, if materials are gathered, you can craft ammunition yourself using your Tinker’s Tools at half the cost. Each firearm uses its own unique ammunition and is generally sold or crafted in batches listed below next to the price.

&lt;b&gt;THIS IS UNOFFICIAL MATERIAL&lt;/b&gt;

These game mechanics are usable in your campaign if your DM allows them but not refined by final game design and editing. They aren’t officially part of the Dungeons &amp; Dragons game and aren’t permitted in D&amp;D Adventurers League events unless otherwise stated.

The attack misses, and the weapon cannot be used again until you spend an action to try and repair it. To repair your firearm, you must make a successful Tinker’s Tools check (DC equal to 8 + misfire score). If your check fails, the weapon is broken and must be mended out of combat at a quarter of the cost of the firearm. Creatures who use a firearm without being proficient increase the weapon’s misfire score by 1.

&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Explosive.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Upon a hit, everything within 5 ft of the target must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier) or suffer 1d8 fire damage. If the weapon misses, the ammunition fails to detonate, or bounces away harmlessly before doing so.

&lt;b&gt;Ammunition&lt;/b&gt;

All firearms require ammunition to make an attack, and due to their rare nature, ammunition may be near impossible to find or purchase. However, if materials are gathered, you can craft ammunition yourself using your Tinker’s Tools at half the cost. Each firearm uses its own unique ammunition and is generally sold or crafted in batches listed below next to the price.

&lt;b&gt;THIS IS UNOFFICIAL MATERIAL&lt;/b&gt;

These game mechanics are usable in your campaign if your DM allows them but not refined by final game design and editing. They aren’t officially part of the Dungeons &amp; Dragons game and aren’t permitted in D&amp;D Adventurers League events unless otherwise stated.

		<text>The double-bladed scimitar is the signature weapon of Valenar elves. A haft of fine wood supports a long, curving blade on either end. Forged with techniques honed over centuries, these blades are strong, sharp, and remarkably light. Each scimitar is a masterpiece, and as a result the double-bladed scimitar is an expensive weapon (100 gp) - few though ever have the opportunity to purchase one. A Valenar blade in the hands of a non-elf is generally assumed to have been stolen or looted from a fallen foe, and a Valenar elf might feel entitled to demand its return or challenge the bearer to prove they’re worthy to wield it.

&lt;b&gt;Special.&lt;/b&gt; If you attack with a double-bladed scimitar as part of the Attack action on your turn, you can use a bonus action immediately after to make a melee attack with it. This attack deals 1d4 slashing damage on a hit, instead of 2d4.
